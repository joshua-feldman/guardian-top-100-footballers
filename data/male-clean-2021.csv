And it's no surprise – his goalscoring feats continue to defy logic. By mid-December he had scored 66 goals in 57 competitive games for club and country. At the end of the 2020-21 season he won his seventh Bundesliga title but Bayern were not able to repeat their Champions League triumph, going out to Paris Saint-Germain in the quarter-finals; tellingly Lewandowski was injured for the two games against the French side. The Bayern Munich manager, Julian Nagelsmann, says: “I think Lewy can achieve a lot, also at an older age, because of his physique, lifestyle and the way he lives as a footballer.” He is destined to be back on the list next year, possibly as a winner for a third consecutive year.","Marcus Christenson"

Messi nevertheless ended last season as La Liga’s top scorer and won another Copa del Rey, propping up a feckless Barcelona and once again justifying his uninterrupted presence in this rankings' top three. His time in Paris has been more muted, albeit punctuated by moments of magic such as his first goal for the club, against Manchester City. His stellar Champions League performances remain the one constant from his Catalan years – but PSG won’t mind that if he can propel them to the big prize next year.","Raphaël Jucobin"

Last season may have been a toil for his club but Salah's individual contribution to a campaign that secured Champions League qualification remained immense, with 31 goals in total. He is on course to easily surpass that tally this term, having become the first Liverpool player since Ian Rush in the 1980s to hit the 20-goal mark in five successive seasons. The Egypt international's outstanding form has prompted Jürgen Klopp to call him the best player in the world.","Andy Hunter"

On the pitch, Benzema has reached a level unreachable for most footballers – and for many years spent in service to others, even for him. With 18 goals and eight assists already this season at the time of writing, the stats provide the headline and the watertight case, but it’s not really that; it’s that everything he does, he does well, a forward of impeccable intelligence and technique on the pitch.","Sid Lowe"

He was in and out of the Chelsea team under Frank Lampard and had still not shaken off the associations with Sarriball. Now, though, nobody doubts Jorginho’s class. The 30-year-old took his game to new heights after Thomas Tuchel replaced Lampard and he did not slow down after helping Chelsea win the Champions League. Jorginho was a controlling presence for Italy at Euro 2020 and he had an exceptional game when they beat England in the final. Just don’t remind him about missing a penalty in the shootout.","Jacob Steinberg"

He rebounded brilliantly from his summer disappointment to lead France to the Nations League title, and has PSG poised to win Ligue 1 by a record margin. Still only 23, his game continues to develop as well; at the time of writing he has the most assists in France this season and, with another four in the Champions League, has become both the attacking focal point and creative hub of the capital side. Whether he leaves Paris next summer remains to be seen, but for now he continues to be as electric and compelling a presence on the pitch as ever.","Eric Devin"

The 21-year-old continues to average roughly a goal a game for club and country, his consistency remarkable for a player so young. He was injured for a spell in late October and November and during that period Borussia Dortmund lost so much ground in their Champions League group that they were eliminated. He may drop a place in our rankings but he was only nine points behind Kylian Mbappé. He made 211 out of 219 voting slips this year and two judges had him as the best player in the world in 2021. Maybe he is not quite there yet, but there is no reason why he can’t be in the future.","Marcus Christenson"

The latter was two years younger and there was zero debate about his ability out of possession. Now, particularly with Ralf ""godfather of pressing"" Rangnick as United’s interim manager, the supremely talented Portuguese is viewed via the narrow prism of how much he can close down. Ronaldo, simply, remains an asset. For a struggling United he has quickly reached double figures for goals this season, and was the Capocannoniere in Serie A in 2020-21 with 29.","Jamie Jackson"

He overpowered Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid en route to the final and was man of the match when Manchester City were beaten in Porto.“He is a super man,” Thomas Tuchel says. “The guy everyone in the whole world wants in his midfield.” The only problem, though, is that Kanté is not in Chelsea’s midfield enough. He has struggled to stay fit since 2019 and has been in and out this season. It is just as well that he was ready to face City.

The figures might not look phenomenal but he featured in only 25 matches.

However, the 28-year-old was immense as Inter powered to their first Serie A title in 11 years, scoring 24 times and providing 10 assists. “He is like an American football player,” his coach at Inter, Antonio Conte, said in Feburary. “He is an unusual footballer. He is a centre-forward, he acts as a target man, and he is very fast.” In the summer he returned to Chelsea 10 years after first walking through the doors at Cobham and is hoping to make his presence felt after a stop-start beginning to his second coming at Stamford Bridge.","Marcus Christenson"

His nonchalant swagger after keeping out Bukayo Saka’s spot-kick to seal Italy’s triumph in the final made it look like this all came too easy. In truth, “I didn’t realise we had won!” he said. Returning to our top 100 for the first time since 2016, Donnarumma impressed for Milan early in the year, too, but ends it in a job-share with Keylor Navas at Paris Saint-Germain.","Nicky Bandini"

Although most of his peers would be satisfied with 23-goal contributions in 34 PSG games in 2021 (six of his 12 goals were penalties), after 31 contributions in 27 club outings across 2020 it may not be too soon to talk of a decline with the Brazilian turning 30 in early February. Such is his gargantuan talent, however, he has had his moments, often dragging PSG over the line in tight Ligue 1 games as the showman morphed into a fierce matchwinner. Unfortunately, however, some joyous displays in the Copa América aside, that happened increasingly infrequently this year.","Adam White"

Dias cost £61.2m from Benfica and looked instantly assured in the Premier League, quickly becoming a leader on and off the pitch, even captaining the club, an impressive feat for the 24-year-old. He ensured City conceded only 32 goals on their way to winning the title thanks to his classy and determined defending. “Rúben Dias is the best centre-back in the world now,” José Mourinho said. “With his move to the Premier League with Man City, he is getting a different level of knowledge.

But the numbers have not told the story of a rollercoaster time, captured in microcosm at Euro 2020 when Kane laboured terribly before scoring late on against Germany in the last 16 to locate the ignition key. At Spurs, it has been trying, his failed push for a summer move to Manchester City being the low point.","David Hytner"

This was underscored when Fernandes’s first flatlining of form since arriving in January 2020 coincided with United’s dismal two months this autumn, a period that ended with Ole Gunnar Solskjær being sacked. Fernandes scored a hat-trick against Leeds on the opening day and managed only one more goal for United until 2 December.

Federico wound up playing as many games for the Azzurri this year as his dad did in an entire career. He started the Euros on the bench but made himself undroppable after an extra-time winner against Austria and followed up with a brilliant goal in the semi-final against Spain. Goals against Porto and Chelsea in the Champions League further demonstrated his habit for rising to big occasions – even when teammates couldn’t.

Likely to lead for club and country going forward, he then attracted criticism for his publicly expressed vaccine scepticism in the autumn and missed the end of the year with Covid and a lung infection.

Then he went to the Copa América and inspired Argentina to victory, memorably making three saves in the penalty shootout win over Colombia in the semi-final after sledging the takers. “Martínez is fundamental,” said none other than Lionel Messi in September. “When opponents come at him, he always has an answer.”","Paul Doyle"

His exploits earned him 18th place in the Ballon d’Or rankings and a host of awards.
