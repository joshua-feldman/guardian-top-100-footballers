Kanté is all scuttling energy, a blur of interceptions. The French literally sung his praises after Russia, rejoicing in his understated style. Chelsea value him highly, warding off Paris Saint-Germain’s interest for now with a new five-year contract worth £290,000-a-week in the autumn. He has actually found periods of the domestic campaign to date something of a chore having been displaced as the midfield pivot by Jorginho, with Maurizio Sarri demanding the 27-year-old is more of a progressive force these days on the right of a three. If the Italian can eke goals and creativity from Kanté’s game, he will surely remain upwardly mobile in this survey.","Dominic Fifield","SMc√","JA","JA","NA","","Top 100 footballers 2017:the best talents in the world","The Guardian picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.

The hype around the midfielder is extraordinary and it seems inevitable that he will leave Ajax in the summer; Barcelona and Manchester City are interested. Yet De Jong, who has helped Ajax reach the last 16 of the Champions League and the Netherlands qualify for the Nations League finals, is relaxed. “I don’t want to compare myself to any big player,” he says. “When people do that, it’s difficult to meet expectations.”","Jacob Steinberg","","","","","","Top 100 footballers 2017:the best talents in the world","The Guardian picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.
