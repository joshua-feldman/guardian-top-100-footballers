But none of it takes away from a year in which she starred on a regular basis, including two goals in the German Cup semi-final and a spectacular strike against Slavia Prague in Europe. With her ability to beat players, her technical prowess and her eye for goal, Harder is now arguably the most complete women’s footballer in the world. She led the goalscoring charts in the Bundesliga come the end of Wolfsburg’s title-winning 2017-18 season and, while she trailed her teammate Ewa Pajor so far this term, six goals domestically by the end of November and another half-dozen in the Champions League ensure Harder claims this year's No 1 spot.","Rich Laverty","100","MC√","NA√","RB","header-image-1_albatross.png"

Kerr's year began in her home country with a hat-trick for Perth Glory against Canberra United before she returned to the US. She scored three braces during the course of the NWSL season plus a hat-trick against her former club, helping the Red Stars reach the play-offs, where they lost 2-0 to the eventual champions North Carolina Courage.

She helped an all-star Lyon side win both the Division 1 Féminine and a third consecutive Champions League, scoring in the final against Wolfsburg. The Norwegian ended the 2017/18 season with 31 goals, 10 clear of the next best, and is already well on her way to another stellar campaign. An outstanding tally of 15 Champions League goals, seven more than her nearest rival, emphatically earned her the golden boot, while strikes in both legs against Ajax helped Lyon progress to this season’s quarter-finals. Still <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/03/lyon-ada-hegerberg-ronaldo-champions-league-goals"">in the international wilderness</a>, Hegerberg did not return to Norway duty in 2018 as Martin Sjögren’s side beat Netherlands to an automatic World Cup spot, but her lack of football on that stage has done nothing to downgrade her talent or reputation.","Rich Laverty","100","MC√","NA√","RB","header-image-1_albatross.png"

Bronze got what she craved after leaving behind the WSL, winning the French title and starting the Champions League final. She did not quite live up to her reputation for popping up with goals, but did recently score against Ajax and saved her best for last season’s Champions League semi-final against her former club, where her stunning volley not only <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/29/olympique-lyon-manchester-city-women-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report"">clinched the tie for Lyon</a> but was nominated for Uefa’s goal of the year award. A sixth-placed ranking in Fifa’s The Best awards was well-earned and she has continued to be a regular at national team level, with the England head coach Phil Neville describing her as one of the leading players in the world.

Asserting herself as a big game player, Le Sommer scored a vital away goal against Barcelona in the last eight and produced the 99th minute effort that gave them a 2-1 lead over Wolfsburg in the final. As if to emphasise her quality, a hat-trick against Toulouse in February ensured she is now Lyon’s greatest goalscorer ever, a tally that amounted to 226 at the time but is now approaching 250.

Four goals from midfield were just the tip of the iceberg as Lyon won another domestic title, but her biggest moment came in Kiev when Lyon were trailing Wolfsburg 1-0 and looked to be on the verge of missing out on the Champions League title. She equalised in the 98th minute, turning the tie and helping Lyon go on to lift the trophy. But Henry's talents extend well beyond her goals. Her ability on the ball, composure and range of passing all catch the eye and make an impact at international level too. Corinne Diacre's France team count on her contributions, which this year included their first goal of the year against Italy and another in an impressive 3-0 win over Germany.

As Orlando Pride struggled for consistency in 2018 and said goodbye to their manager, Tom Sermanni, Morgan scored just five NWSL goals and never struck in consecutive games, although she did find the net in big early season wins against Portland Thorns and Chicago Red Stars. It was on the international stage that she really starred, though, as Jill Ellis’s side went unbeaten in 2018. She scored 18 times in their 20 games this year, starting off with a goal against Euro 2017 runners-up Denmark. Two braces in a row against Mexico followed, while her best moment was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/26/uswnt-japan-alex-morgan-hat-trick"">a hat-trick against Japan</a>, their opponents in the last two World Cup finals. While her quality in front of goal remains unquestionable for her country, one wonders just how much more Morgan can offer for her club in 2019 – but she should play a key role in the USA's bid to retain the World Cup next summer.","Rich Laverty","200","MC√","NA√","RB√","header-image-1_albatross.png"

Standing at 187cm, Renard is now among the most recognisable players in the world and, as captain of Lyon, has been pivotal in the club’s success in recent years. Given her height, it is no surprise Renard also chips in with a goal or two, most recently scoring twice in a league win against Dijon just days after another brace in the Champions League against Ajax. Her latest spot in the top 10 reflects an incredible consistency in performance and demonstrates how highly she is rated around the world. Renard has not always been in favour with new France head coach Corinne Diacre but, after a spell out at the start of the year through injury, she has returned to being a regular and will play an important role should Les Bleus win their home World Cup in 2019.","Rich Laverty","200","MC√","NA√","RB√","header-image-1_albatross.png"

While Barça missed out on the Liga Iberdrola title to Atlético Madrid, Martens hit double figures for the season – with seven of them coming since the beginning of 2018. They had better fortunes in the domestic cup and, after Martens scored in the 94th minute of the semi-final against Athletic Club, Fran Sánchez’s side went on to beat Atlético in the final. On the international front, the Netherlands struggled to build on 2017’s successes but the recent play-off victory over Switzerland – in which Martens also found the net – ensured them a place at next summer's World Cup.

The winger showed no after-effects of the serious injury that kept her out for much of 2016 and could hardly have started Seattle's NWSL season much better. She scored four goals in the opening four games and provided several assists along the way; even though her form fluctuated after that, Reign reached the play-offs. She was once again prominent as USA went unbeaten across 20 matches, linking up with her fellow attackers to fine effect and coming up with the winner in their opening SheBelieves Cup match against Germany. Rapinoe contributed to five of the USA’s goals in a 6-2 win over Mexico, scoring one and assisting four others, and helped her side book a place in France to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/aug/03/five-things-the-uswnt-must-do-to-successfully-defend-the-world-cup"">defend their World Cup title</a>.","Rich Laverty","200","MC√","NA√","RB√","header-image-1_albatross.png"

The youngster has gone up a few gears this season and by the end of November had 12 league goals, including three hat-tricks, putting her six clear of her teammate Pernille Harder and anyone else in the league.

She popped up with two goals and an assist during the course of the NWSL campaign, while three goals for Australia have seen her remain highly valued by Alen Stajcic. Now she has returned to her home country for the off-season, this time with Sydney FC. Kennedy could not have got off to a much better start, showing her quality with a super goal against Melbourne Victory recently even though her team went on to lose.","Rich Laverty","100","MC√","RB√","NA√","header-image-1_albatross.png"

Goessling was not always a regular as Wolfsburg closed out the domestic double in 2017-18 but she started several big games, including the German Cup final against Bayern Munich. She has continued to feature regularly for Germany as they prepare for the World Cup, but sadly an injury has ended her year earlier than planned.","Rich Laverty","100","MC√","RB√","NA√","header-image-1_albatross.png"
