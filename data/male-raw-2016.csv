While his apparently insatiable desire to make everything from the most informal dressing-room team photo to the highlight reels of the biggest football spectacles all about him may grate more often than amuse, it is difficult to ignore the reality that football's most preening showman is rarely found wanting ... even on the rare occasions he is found wanting. Having failed to score in the Champions League final, he stepped up to fire home the decisive spot-kick in the shootout. After limping off in the first half of Portugal's win over France in the Euro 2016 decider, he appointed himself de facto coach to roar, gesticulate and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/10/cristiano-ronaldo-tears-portugal-greatest-night"" >will his less talented team-mates to victory</a> against the hosts.

Messi has set the bar so high, made the ridiculous so routine, that a year (by mid-December) in which he produced the most goals (59) and assists (36), in which he completed more dribbles than anyone else, became Xavi and Messi rolled together, won a league and cup double and took Argentina to a third final in a row, is judged a disappointment somehow. He would have thought so too when he missed that penalty at the Copa América. So much so that afterwards, he <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/27/lionel-messi-says-he-is-quitting-argentina-team-after-copa-america-final-defeat"" >said that he was going to give up on international football</a>, only to change his mind – to everyone’s relief.

He has started to “Di Stéfano”, one newspaper said, playing everywhere and as everything. His range of passing all over the pitch, always better than anyone else’s but hidden behind the goals, the dribbles and the assists, is getting talked about at last.

Griezmann was instrumental in both those odysseys, providing much of the art and sharpness to Diego Simeone's dynamic machine. He scored goals in the Champions League quarter-final win against Barcelona and the semi-final elimination of Bayern Munich but missed a penalty in extra time of the final against Real Madrid before netting in the losing shootout. After all that he made a slow start to Euro 2016, deployed wide on the right in France's first match and dropped for the second.

Yet he has not performed at his usual high level for Barcelona this season, scoring only six goals by mid-December, and there has been a little weariness to his play.

There was a point last year when Bale seemed unhappy at Real Madrid, little more than a support act as the Cristiano Ronaldo show rolled on, and Manchester United’s ears pricked up when the Bernabéu crowd whistled the Welshman for not passing to his illustrious team-mate in May 2015. But they don’t do that any more. Few players are as devastating as the Welshman when he sets off on one of those rampaging runs, demolishing defences with the explosiveness of his dribbling, confounding goalkeepers with that gorgeous left foot, and he has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/23/real-madrid-gareth-bale-spain-champions-league-manchester-city"" >accepted more responsibility</a> in a year when Ronaldo has been slightly less present for Real.

In the era of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, that will not be easy for the 28-year-old. Pure centre-forwards, adept at leading the line and scoring goals on an industrial scale, are also not as universally revered – nor indeed valued by coaches – as they were before the advent of the highlight-reel commandeering attacking midfielder/striker hybrids. Two more of that mould, Antoine Griezmann and Gareth Bale, have moved ahead of him in the ranking, even though his own performances for club and country have been just as devastating as in previous seasons. His <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/22/bayern-wolfsburg-match-report"" >five goals in the space of nine minutes as a substitute against VfL Wolfsburg</a> in January broke four world records. More recently, he has added goals from free-kicks to his oeuvre. Orthodox No9s who concentrate on the most important thing in football, the getting-the-ball-over-the-line bit, might be in danger of going out of fashion, but Lewandowski’s specialist skill-set, the combination of superb athleticism and sublime finishing, is so impressive that he is single-handedly bucking the trend.","Raphael Honigstein","200","√SM","RC","RC","NAm"

Despite Aubameyang's importance to Dortmund, the club's manager, Thomas Tuchel, dropped him when he made an unauthorised excursion to Milan in November.
