Putellas ended the 2021-22 domestic season with 18 goals and 15 assists, and was the top scorer as her side reached the Champions League final. Forty-six of our judges made Putellas their No 1, the exact same number as last year, as she once again won by a similar margin of just under 300 points.","","","day_4_marrow.jpg"

She has had a tremendous year, clicking into top gear just after the hurt of missing out on the squad for the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and both her scoring and assists record for Arsenal set up what was an incredible summer for the now fearless winger. Mead took centre stage at the European Championship where she again topped the scoring and assists charts, including the crucial opener in the semi-final against Sweden. Her contributions went a long way to helping the Lionesses’ long wait for a trophy and she started the new season in good goalscoring form, but an ACL injury last month will sideline her for a chunk of 2023.","","","day_4_marrow.jpg"

She has shown a penchant for finding the net in the biggest games, but in different ways. If it wasn’t her calm chip against Arsenal in last December's Cup final, it was her spectacular volley on the final day of the season against Manchester United when the title looked like it was slipping out of their grasp.

It would be unfair to say Bonmatí has only stepped up in the absence of Putellas for both club and country as there is every argument to suggest she was reaching that level anyway. The Spaniard helped drag her national side through the Euros and to almost topple eventual champions England in the quarter-finals. Those performances was so much down to her ability and tenacity, with her game against the Lionesses a particular standout. A constant creator capable of controlling even the biggest of games, aged 24 it feels as if Bonmatí is going to hold down a spot as one of the very best in the world for years to come.","","","day_4_marrow.jpg"

The all-action defensive midfielder was named best young player at Euro 2022 and only turned 21 earlier this week. It was almost frightening to watch how Oberdorf dealt with the biggest and toughest tests during the summer and how much better she can go on to become, given she has already established herself as one of the very best around. Not afraid to make a tackle, Oberdorf’s ability to both read and influence games is well beyond her years. She has been one of the youngest players to make the top 100 list over the past few years and is the youngest face in the top 10. It will be no surprise to see her place highly for the next decade given how high her talent ceiling is.","","","day_4_marrow.jpg"

Before the Euros, she was in fine form for her club and ended last season’s WSL campaign with 14 goals and eight assists, second only to Sam Kerr. Sadly for Miedema, she was one of many players hit by Covid-19 during the tournament and unable to recover enough to stop the Dutch going out against France in the quarter-finals. Miedema then took a much-needed break and returned looking better for it, showing glimpses of the top-10 player she is … but then she ruptured her ACL, which she says will rule her out of next year's World Cup. So cruel as, when fit, Miedema remains one of the most technically gifted around, with a rare ability to score and create in equal measure.","","","day_4_marrow.jpg"

Her six goals equalled the tally of Beth Mead, and her double to drag Germany through the semi-final against France will live long in the memory. Missing the final through injury was absolutely heartbreaking for the Wolfsburg forward but by then she had reminded everyone of just how good she is, having been 19th on our list two years ago. She has taken that form into the new season with both club and country. Hence a jump up into the top 10 for the first time for a player who at 31 may yet still have one more Euros in her when 2025 comes around.","","","day_4_marrow.jpg"

The Norwegian continues to be a threat when it comes to both scoring goals and creating them and the ease with which she is able to gracefully skip past players sets her apart from most wingers in the game. She had a tough European Championship as Norway struggled in their group, not making it as far as the knockouts. But at club level she played a pivotal role in another trophy-filled year for Barcelona.

Six of our judges picked Walsh as their No 1, just one fewer than Kerr in third. It had always felt like Walsh had gone underappreciated outside of England, but a combination of a sensational Euros and a huge move to Barcelona in the summer has changed all of that. There are few in the game able to dictate matches like Walsh, and she showed her skill and vision on the biggest stage throughout the summer’s Euros, culminating in her brilliant assist for Ella Toone’s opener in the final at Wembley. That magnificent pass was exactly the kind of fare those who watch Walsh every week have become accustomed to and, as she settles into Barça life, it will be intriguing to see how she develops her game further in Spain.","","","day_4_marrow.jpg"

A culmination of finding something close to her best form, her role in England’s Euro 2022-winning side and a move to Barcelona are all factors that have moved Bronze closer to the top again, and her ability to perform when the pressure is on remains a key part of her success. She helped Manchester City to a domestic trophy – the Continental Cup – and was once again vital for England, with her dogged performance in the final against Germany particularly impressive. Her talent is still regarded highly enough that Barça took up the option to sign her in the summer, where she is already making a big impact at both ends of the field.","","","day_4_marrow.jpg"

Euro 2022 was touted as potentially being Katoto’s breakthrough tournament but she was injured in the second group game. Before the tournament she had ended the 2021-22 domestic season as the French top flight’s best goalscorer – four clear of the impressive Catarina Macario – cementing herself as one of Europe’s elite in front of goal.","","","day_4_marrow.jpg"

It was a historic year for the towering centre-back who won another Champions League trophy, just as it looked as though Lyon’s reign was over, but glory continues to evade her on an international stage.

Her club form raised questions over the past few years but Morgan's scoring led San Diego Wave to a superb first-season run to the playoff semi-finals.

Though not representing one of France's top teams or one of the top nations in the world, she is still providing the goods, earning a young player of the season nomination in France last season for Reims, while her performances for Haiti at the Concacaf Championship earned her player of the tournament outright. A natural ability to break forward and both score and create goals, Dumornay's ceiling is sky high and with it she becomes the first Haitian player to make our top 100.","SG**","GS","day_4_marrow.jpg"

She barely missed a minute of league action last season and has not missed a single one so far this term too. An experienced head with an abundance of defensive qualities, Hendrich was in great form for Germany, particularly during their run to the Euro 2022 final. Very few showed the heart and desire Hendrich had during the tournament and she played a huge role in her team's success at both domestic and international level throughout this year – with that, she sneaks into the 100 for the first time.","GS","SG**","day_4_marrow.jpg"
