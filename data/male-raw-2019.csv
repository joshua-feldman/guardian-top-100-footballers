Ninety, by our calculations. It would not be that much of an exaggeration, either. Player of the year is a different debate, and a lot more open, but Messi was Europe’s top scorer and the Champions League’s top scorer too, despite the fact that, as he said when he <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/02/ballon-dor-lionel-messi-megan-rapinoe"">collected the Ballon d’Or</a>, he’s a “constructor” not a goalscorer. Even that old line about how he disappeared at Anfield isn’t actually true: try watching the game again. And in the end, it’s quite simple: no one has played like Messi in 2019.

The striker’s tall and muscular frame had led previous coaches to deploy him as an old-fashioned target man, but in Bergamo Zapata has demonstrated he can be devastating when allowed to play facing the goal. His club form earned him a recall to the Colombian national team, for whom he started, and scored twice, during their run to the quarter-finals of the Copa América.","Nicky Bandini","","","","","Top 100 footballers 2017:the best talents in the world","The Guardian picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.

He is not good ‘considering’ everything; he’s just good, full stop. No midfielder has made more chances in Spain so far this season. Still a genius, still smiling.","Sid Lowe","","","","","Top 100 footballers 2017:the best talents in the world","The Guardian picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.

The club’s failure to appear in the next six editions of that competition might explain why his name has not appeared on this list since 2013. In truth, Handanovic’s performances remained impressive throughout – even when the team around him was not. A consistent and commanding presence, he was a natural choice to take over the captain’s armband after it was stripped from Mauro Icardi in February. His peers voted him as the best goalkeeper in Serie A for 2019.","Nicky Bandini","","","","","Top 100 footballers 2017:the best talents in the world","The Guardian picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.

That may partly be explained by the fact that, at 28, he is around his peak but he has been their best performer at times and has bailed out a number of subpar showings. He has also produced at key moments, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/18/napoli-arsenal-europa-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report"">scoring a brilliant free-kick at Napoli</a> in the Europa League quarter-finals and putting three past Valencia across the two legs to help seal a spot in the final. His all-round game, particularly leading the line, has developed considerably; there is a nagging doubt about his away record, though, with only three of 16 goals to early December coming on the road.","Nick Ames","","","","","Top 100 footballers 2017:the best talents in the world","The Guardian picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.
