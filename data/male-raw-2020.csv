His numbers are incredible; he finished 2019-20 with 55 goals in 47 club matches for Bayern Munich, and became only the second player to finish top scorer in all three competitions of a treble season after Johan Cruyff for Ajax in 1972. Later he moved into third on the Champions League all-time scorers’ list, level with Raúl. Yet when his coach Hansi Flick says “he’s in the form of his life”, he doesn’t just mean the goals. The 32-year-old Lewandowski still relishes the physical battle of being a No 9 and is a talisman for his younger teammates. With him set to dominate for years to come, Bayern may well do so too.

The key, as always with Morata, is that he has a manager who trusts him and in his former teammate Pirlo he has just that.
