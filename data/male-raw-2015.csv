Ronaldo scored goals from any distance and any angle and <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/05/cristiano-ronaldo-film-messi"" >you just have to watch the film-documentary about him</a> to understand that it is the competition with Messi, more than anything else, that drives him to these heights. Yet his old adversary, once again, has that little extra on top. Messi is still the player you always want on the ball. He is still the player <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/07/lionel-messi-barcelona-bayern-munich"" >who takes the sport to its greatest heights</a> and there is still that instantaneous ripple of expectation when he moves on to the ball, wherever he is on the pitch and whoever he is playing against.
Remember, just to cite one example, that exquisitely delivered nutmeg to find the gap between James Milner’s legs <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/18/barcelona-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report"" >when Manchester City played at Camp Nou</a> in the Champions League? You might recall how, high in the stands, Pep Guardiola could be seen with his head in his hands, howling with laughter at the impudence of his former player. Messi does it as a matter of routine: the speed, the balance, the self-belief to back himself every time, the anticipation, the knowledge of how to make the ball do whatever he wants. And that hunger. 
Messi has been at the top of his sport for years but never leaves the sense that he wants to stop to admire the view. There is never a flicker of complacency, just that fixed expression and the clear sense that no matter who the opposition put on him, whoever kicks him and however much they try to negate him, he will always find a way. 
There is not enough said about the personal discipline that must go into maintaining that standard of excellence, but it is one of the principal reasons why this small man with the rarest gifts is a giant of the sport.","Daniel Taylor","300","SMc√","SMc√","NAm√",""

In a year when Cristiano Ronaldo seemed more or less the same, just slightly less so, he was the top pick on the Top 100 list of just 7% of judges  after careering off as <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2014/dec/21/the-top-100-footballers-2014-interactive"" >runaway leader last year</a> with a massive 74%. At the same time Real Madrid's all-time <em>galáctico</em>, by mid-December, had still managed to score 52 goals for club and country, set a new Guinness world record for all-time ""most liked"" person on Facebook, and churned out a familiarly relentless stream of goals, assists, shots and arm-waggling sprints from that bespoke centre forward role. Aged 30, with 12 years of elite level football behind him, there is a sense of Ronaldo's powers not so much diminishing as condensing. This, it seems, is his way of ageing. He still runs a lot, just with an ever narrower range, more focused on shooting and scoring. Even in a so-so non-trophy year by mid-December Ronaldo still managed 327 shots at goal for club and country. His detractors will point out that he has been the hammer of the second-rankers with 28 goals – more than half his annual total – in eight games against Malmo, Espanyol, Shakhtar Donetsk, Getafe, Granada and Armenia. His supporters might point to the fact he is still jaw-droppingly prolific even in an unsettled Real team, under a manager with whom he appears to have an anti-chemistry, testament not just to his talent but to that relentless champion's will.","Barney Ronay","200","MC√","MC√","TB√","NAm√"

He has won the treble with Barcelona, been joint top scorer in the Champions League, including a goal in the final, and <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/02/neymar-luis-suarez-barcelona-messi"" >has played a leading role so far this season in the absence of Lionel Messi</a> with performances that have been consistently extraordinary and fantastically fun too.
That was perhaps best encapsulated by the remark made by his team-mate Luis Suárez: “We all know our roles,” the Uruguayan said. “I don’t dribble round three or four players like Neymar does.” It’s true, Neymar does, over and over again, a trail of bamboozled defenders left in his wake. “He’s electric. When he runs into the area, either they commit a penalty or he scores,” Luis Enrique said. 
And if that might sound frivolous, it is not: the productivity in 2015 has been quite astonishing. Dunga described him as the best player in the world and when he scored <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/10/best-goals-week-neymar-sergio-ramos-alexandre-lacazette"" >an outrageously good goal against Villarreal,</a> flicking the ball over the defender before volleying it in, Gerard Piqué admiringly insisted: “I have no idea how he did it.

In 2015 he hit the jackpot, finding at the age of 28, after more than 500 games as a professional, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/05/luis-suarez-champions-league-final-berlin"" >the extreme outer limits of his own brilliant striking talent</a>. Suárez was the No1 pick of 8% of judges, more than Cristiano Ronaldo, but his influence is stamped right across that top four. Switched to the centre at the end of last year the Uruguayan was Barcelona's catalyst, glue, and alternately the brains and muscle of the side's sublime attacking trident, creating space with his movement and hustle, linking brilliantly and helping to elevate both his front-running partners to new, or in Messi's case renewed, levels. More than 40 goals for club and country were his most tangible contribution. Missing the Copa América because of his ban for biting during the 2014 World Cup is the only negative, and the most obvious argument against nudging Suárez, the star player who makes other star players play, even higher.","Barney Ronay","200","MC√","MC√","TB√","NAm√"

How ridiculous those misgivings feel now. After a slightly awkward start to 2015, which began with Lewandowski trotting off in the 71st minute of a 4-1 defeat to Wolfsburg in January, he has cemented his reputation as the deadliest striker in Europe and risen 25 places in our rankings.
A significant moment in his Bayern career arrived when he scored twice in the 6-1 victory over Porto in the last eight of the Champions League in April and his numbers since then are startling.

But this year Thomas Müller, the son of a BMW engineer, has mostly been employed in a more central role at Bayern Munich, behind Robert Lewandowski. 
Closer proximity to the goal has resulted in increased output. Müller is on course for his highest-scoring season, having been prolific in the Bundesliga already. A very successful penalty-taking technique – Müller waits for the 'keeper to make up his mind and does not look at the ball before his strike – has added to his impressive numbers. 
“Müller can play badly for 90 minutes but still score,” his former youth coach at Bayern, Hermann Gerland, once said. Louis van Gaal, the Dutch coach who mentored his breakthrough at the Allianz Arena in 2009, is an admirer: Manchester United were keen to lure him to Old Trafford this summer, but Bayern have declared him officially “unsellable”. Müller, a proud Bavarian, is so highly valued for his effectiveness on the pitch and leadership qualities off it that there’s already talk of the 26-year-old taking on an important role at the club after his career.","Raphael Honigstein","200","SMc√","SMc√","TB√","NAm√"

Still a talisman for club and country, he seems determined to make the most of his final years in top-level football. He scored 19 goals in 24 matches in the 2014-15 season as PSG won the league by eight points and had 12 goals in 12 league games in early December 2015 as his club opened up a chastening 15-point gap at the top of the table. And that was despite persistent injury problems at the start of the 2015-16 season. 
Controversy, as always, was never far away and in March he lost his temper after a game against Bordeaux, swore at the referee and said that France was ""a shit country"".

The 29-year-old has long left his line behind to become a truly postmodern No1, a defender in gloves, a keeper who dictates the rhythm and direction of his team’s buildup play with pinpoint passes from his own box. 
When he was 13, coaches at his boyhood club Schalke were so concerned by his lack of height that they considered using him as an outfielder. Neuer believes he could have held his own there too, but a growth spurt put him back on track. 
This year has been a relatively barren one for the World Cup winner, delivering only another Bundesliga title with Bayern – his third in four seasons at the Allianz Arena – but Neuer continues to set the benchmark for all-round ability. 
His ease on the ball makes it much harder for opponents to press the defenders – he is always available as an outlet – and his frequent interventions outside the box stifle many threats before they materialise. “It’s riskier not to intercept the ball,” he says, “because world class strikers make very few mistakes.” Needless to say, neither does he.","Raphael Honigstein","200","SMc√","SMc√","TB√","NAm√"

His razor-sharp movement makes him a nightmare to mark but also a perfect foil for creators at club and country, such as David Silva, Lionel Messi and Kevin De Bruyne. His nerveless last-minute penalty against Borussia Mönchengladbach provided the springboard for City's qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League.

De Bruyne’s performance for Wolfsburg <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/30/wolfsburg-bayern-munich-bundesliga-match-report"">in that 4-1 thrashing of Bayern</a> must go down as one of the finest individual displays this year.

José Mourinho <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/23/jose-mourinho-kevin-de-bruyne-mentality-manchester-city-wolfsburg"">must be furious with himself</a> for letting De Bruyne join Wolfsburg in January 2014.

He made the second-most chances in the top five European leagues last season and that persuaded City to sign him for £54m in the summer. He has settled well after returning to the Premier League, scoring frequently for his new side, and he played a pivotal role in City reaching the last 16 of the Champions League, drilling in a stoppage-time winner in <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/21/manchester-city-sevilla-champions-league-match-report"">the 2-1 victory over Sevilla</a> in October.

He made costly mistakes at the back and he was even dropped after the defeat to Liverpool in March. However, City still find it difficult to play without their captain and leader. Kompany has improved this season and it is worth noting that, by mid December, City had only conceded three goals when he had been on the pitch, compared to 20 when he had been missing.

In the end, though, Real Madrid did not get the deal done. Navas returned to a club that did not want him. “Many things” went though his head, he admitted. He recalled thinking: “I don’t want to go but if I have to go it is because that’s God will ... And in the end God didn’t want me to go. He gave me the opportunity and I don’t want to waste it.” He did not waste it. He might have been sunk, but instead he was strong. His performances were so good, in fact, that while Real Madrid were disappointed not to sign De Gea, they became grateful that the Costa Rican was sticking around. What most sets Navas apart is the speed, the legwork. Then there’s his attitude: there is a quiet, straight, toughness to him, a conviction, a clarity, a competitive determination that is unwavering. His focus is such that even some team-mates find it a little intense, almost comic at times, but it is the reason he has succeeded. When he was at Levante, he made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Spain. He faces fewer shots these days but, before the <em>clásico</em>, he had saved a higher percentage than any other goalkeeper in the country: over 90%. When Real Madrid beat Celta, the Celta striker Nolito remarked: “It’s down to Keylor.

José Mourinho did not want him to join Chelsea's cross-town rivals but Roman Abramovich afforded Cech the respect of allowing him to choose his next club.

Nobody is asking him to stand head and shoulders above the galaxy of talent at Bayern Munich but this has been a relatively humdrum 12 months: he has struggled to make his mark on big games and goals have largely dried up, too. It says something about Götze's majestic early career that he is being judged by these standards but you wonder whether he and Pep Guardiola, who has been reluctant to use him over a full 90 minutes, are the best of fits.

That the latter is the case says everything about the impact Payet has had since joining from Marseille in August. He picked up the pace of the Premier League straightaway, scoring five times in his first nine outings. In his final season in Ligue 1, he had made 17 assists. In Payet, who turns 29 in March, Slaven Bilic’s side have a technically superb, diligent talent who will hope for a return to the France squad in time for Euro 2016.","Nick Ames","100","SMc√","SMc√","NAm√","TB√"

Here was a player who should have been in the prime of his career, 28 years old and an Italy international, turning his back on Serie A in favour of Major League Soccer. As reports trickled in of a $7m per year salary, more than one prominent commentator accused him of selling out his childhood dream of becoming the Juventus No10.

But Giovinco was not the one in need of a reality check. This was his sixth season at Juventus, split across three different spells, and he was no closer to that No10 shirt than he had ever been. Successive managers had failed to get the most from him and now, under Massimiliano Allegri, he was having a hard time finding space in the team.

What Toronto promised, more than money, was a chance to be a leading man. Giovinco grasped that opportunity with both hands, becoming the first player ever to finish as MLS’s (joint) top scorer and leading assist man in the same year.

The numbers alone could not do justice to the sheer entertainment of watching him play. As Giovinco’s confidence returned, so did the feints, touches and tricks that we had seen so regularly during his best season, four years ago, at Parma, but only intermittently since. One veteran MLS writer observed that every free-kick Giovinco took <a href=""https://twitter.com/andrew_wiebe/status/658413907632128000"" >had become ""an event""</a>.

At Juventus, the player had been shackled – forced to play in positions and systems that did not suit him. Toronto built their plans around him and have reaped the rewards. Giovinco looks more confident than at any time in his career, and has even won back his place in the Italy side after briefly losing it in the wake of his move.","Paolo Bandini","300","SMc√","MC√","NAm√","TB√"

His quick feet make him a delight to watch and so does the vision and incision of his passing.
