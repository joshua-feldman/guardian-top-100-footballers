That he misses out on top spot to his arch-rival in this year’s Guardian list having taken the plaudits 12 months ago probably owes much to the fact that his overall goals tally is slightly down on this time last year, although it is still the seventh year in a row that he has topped the half-century mark for club and country. In any case the voting among our 169 judges was incredibly close. Having guided Portugal to a surprise victory at Euro 2016, Ronaldo’s next challenge is to inspire them to a repeat performance at the World Cup, although a treacherous group that includes Spain may represent too much to ask for even a player of his ability. Before then, Real Madrid’s tie against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League will provide an intriguing comparison between him and two of the players tipped to take his mantle one day – Neymar and the teenager Kylian Mbappé.","Ed Aarons","200","MC√","PC","PC","NA","Top 100 footballers 2017:the best talents in the world","The Guardian picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.

Neymar’s status in the PSG project is vast. Leaving the Messi-Suárez-Neymar trident at Barcelona naturally asks different questions of the Brazilian. He has not had many problems scoring and creating goals for his new club. No doubt he can enjoy the fact that in the Champions League group stage from last season to this season Barcelona dropped from 20 to nine goals scored. Paris Saint-Germain’s trend over the same group stage went from 13 goals to 25. The Neymar effect has been an interesting one.

""He is world class because he can do absolutely everything,"" says Pep Guardiola. Perhaps the most remarkable thing that the Belgian can do is coax the attacking intent out of any team-mate by rewarding any run with an impeccable quick pass that demands a similar finish. No one pulled strings in midfield as well as him during 2017. There is still scope for him to score more goals even though he is making progress on that front, as he demonstrated by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/30/chelsea-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report"">walloping in the winning goal for City at Chelsea in September</a>.

He finished last season with his second straight Premier League Golden Boot – he had been the runner-up to Sergio Agüero in 2014-15 – and he has carried his consistency into the Champions League, where a wider audience have come to appreciate his power, deceptive pace and dead-eyed instincts in front of goal. One of the special things about Kane is that he is not a confidence player. Missed chances do not affect him and nor do barren spells, such as his now traditional dry August.

His influence on games has rarely fluctuated: it is near-impossible to find a footballer with comparable passing range and, just as importantly, with such finely-tuned instinct as to when a game needs speeding up or slowing down. The latter was shown in a masterful dousing of a raging Atlético Madrid fire during last season’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/10/atletico-madrid-real-madrid-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report"">Champions League semi-final second leg;</a> Modric went on to be influential in the second half of the final, upping the ante on a Real performance that took time to get going. Perhaps it has become easier to focus on his gifts now that Cristiano Ronaldo, the star of the show for so long, has become less explosive outside the penalty area. A single goal for Real in this calendar year hints at one reason for his lack of presence in the headlines; they would be an entirely different side without him though, and so would the Croatia team he captains, although that relationship has not quite been as simple. Modric and company <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/12/croatia-draw-greece-qualify-2018-world-cup"">qualified for the World Cup</a> via the play-offs after the sacking of Ante Cacic, who he had notably refused to support as the national team tottered.

Although it is not really his aim, he got more noticed, too – he’s up 12 places from last year – as he kept the ball always moving with pace and precision on route to Madrid winning a league and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/03/juventus-real-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report"">European Cup double</a> for the first time in 59 years. Precision may just be the word that best defines him, in fact. There’s an elegant efficiency about everything he does from his role just to the left of a midfield three (although it is true that he has occasionally suffered on those rare occasions when he is forced to play a less natural, more defensive role in the absence of Casemiro or when Madrid are under pressure). Kroos doesn’t score many but there is something of a signature goal emerging when he does: running on to the ball, struck cleanly, first time, curling along the floor, almost like a bowling ball on a polished lane, and going in by the post.","Sid Lowe","200","SMc√","PC","PC","JA","Top 100 footballers 2017:the best talents in the world","The Guardian picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.

His significance to his club side was illustrated by Chelsea’s initial toils in their title defence while the Belgian was recovering from ankle surgery, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/05/chelsea-eden-hazard-miss-start-season-ankle-fracture"">undergone over the summer </a>.

""I like to call it a ‘sacred fire’, when you have it inside you, the will to win every game to score goals,"" said the Italian when asked recently about Hazard’s motivation to further his game. ""At this level you must have this type of situation. The flame can be big or little. When you have an inferno it means you are like Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar. Eden has right characteristics to fight with these giants."" That is a measure of his talent. Chelsea’s only real concern is whether they can convince the 26-year-old to sign a contract extension at Stamford Bridge in an attempt to snuff out the interminable <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/sep/15/football-transfer-rumours-eden-hazard-to-real-madrid-next-summer"">rumours of Real Madrid’s interest</a>. Hazard has always wanted to play for Zinedine Zidane.

Rabiot has managed that at PSG though; his more understated stylings have not made as many highlights reels as Neymar or Kylian Mbappé, but a stellar 2017 has seen the young midfielder establish himself as the hub of Unai Emery’s side. In many ways the perfect modern midfielder, Rabiot’s combination of power and efficient distribution meant PSG were confident enough to let both Blaise Matuidi <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/30/west-brom-psg-grzegorz-krychowiak-loan"">and Grzegorz Krychowiak leave</a> in the summer.","Nick Miller","100","SMc√","JA√","JA√","NA","Top 100 footballers 2017:the best talents in the world","The Guardian picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2000 and 31 August 2001, an age band known as first-year scholars.
