Kerr is in the top three for the third year in a row and for the first time is the No 1. How to top a record-breaking 16 NWSL goals in 2018? Score 18. Kerr's goal tally in the 2019 NWSL season was astounding and she was six goals clear of the next best opponent. Her partnership with Yuki Nagasato was a thing of beauty and the sublime nature of her movement, pace and intellect made so many of her goals look so simple. Whether it was her two goals in a big win against the Courage, her four in one game against Jamaica at the World Cup or the hat-trick she scored against Orlando Pride a week after missing a penalty in Australia's World Cup exit, there were goals and class aplenty from Kerr throughout 2019. As rumours swirled of a new challenge for 2020, Kerr will start the new year in fresh surroundings with Chelsea in the FA WSL and it is hard not to be excited about the prospect of seeing her in new territory at the absolute peak of her powers.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Bronze ranks inside the top five for a third year running and only narrowly misses out on top spot. After her performance in the World Cup quarter-final win against Norway in which she cracked in a stunning goal from the edge of the penalty area, she was the name being touted for all the awards but a sub-par performance in the semi-final largely put paid to that. She did, though, win Uefa's Player of the Year award and was a Ballon d'Or nominee.

Her domestic year amounted to a handful of games and no goals, but the month in which she led the USA to a World Cup triumph will live long in the memory. Rapinoe used her skill, movement and precision to devastating effect in the key moments in France. She kept her calm to slot home two penalties against Spain in the second round before her pinnacle came in the quarter-final against France in front of a partisan Parisian crowd. Her early free-kick and subsequent iconic celebration set the tone for a night that would be hers and hers only. A second half tap-in at the back post sent the hosts packing and while she was a surprise omission for the semi-final, the left winger returned to have the first say in the final against the Netherlands, coolly converting a penalty early in the second half to set the USA on their way. Rapinoe's year polarises opinion due to her lack of match action elsewhere, but there can be no argument few had a bigger influence on the USA's back-to-back World Cup success than Rapinoe.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Hegerberg had registered a staggering 20 goals in 14 games across all competitions for Lyon by the end of November, and possesses an almost unique ability to score freely with either foot, her head or create chances for herself and others. She has two hat-tricks and five doubles to her name since the season kicked off in August. But her best moments came in the Champions League final, where an incredible 16-minute hat-trick in the first half-hour devastated Barcelona and sealed a third European trophy in a row for all-conquering Lyon.

She is simply the all-round midfielder, with the ability to pass, score, dictate and be a crucial cog for the most successful club in Europe. Henry does not score many goals but when she does they tend to be big ones, her only club goal in the first half of 2019 coming in the Champions League semi-final win against Chelsea. Maybe Henry was saving her goals for the biggest stage of all as she struck a beauty in France's opening game of the World Cup before popping up with a winner in extra-time of their second-round match against Brazil. But goals are only a small part of Henry's game; what makes her great is that she has so much more.

Five goals in her opening five games of the year was a useful start before six more helped seal Arsenal's first WSL title in seven years. For the Netherlands, she became her nation's all-time top scorer and her World Cup brought three goals on the biggest stage and another major tournament final. Miedema came out of the tournament in top form once again, and had scored 14 goals in across all competitions by the end of November, including seven in two legs against Slavia Prague. Then came the remarkable game against Bristol City in the WSL on 1 December where she scored six and set up four. At 10-0 she had played a part in every single goal. It was a complete performance and seven goals for the Netherlands since the summer only highlight how consistent she is.

A frustrating run of injuries has kept Lavelle out of the 100 since her breakthrough a few years ago but her contribution to the USA's World Cup campaign has put her straight into the top 10. The ease with which Lavelle travels with the ball is a joy to behold and her deceptive pace and trickery gives even the best defenders little chance of stopping her. Her gliding to the edge of the box, side-stepping her marker and smashing the ball past Sari van Veenendaal in the World Cup final was one of the standout moments of the tournament. But Lavelle's contribution was felt throughout, from her two goals against Thailand to her dazzling display against England in the semi-finals. Her NWSL season was restricted but she still found time to score a goal for Washington Spirit that inflicted a rare defeat on North Carolina Courage.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

She is already well out in front in the Bundesliga's scoring charts this season with 12 goals to her name by the end of November, only six short of last season's tally. Harder has found the net in 13 out of 20 games this season for club and country, scoring back-to-back hat-tricks in nine days for Wolfsburg and Denmark. Her ability to both create chances and score from them marks her down as one of the best around. There are few better with the ball at their feet and few more deadly in front of goal.

When you captain the top club in Europe (and one of the leading nations) and win as much as Renard does, it is hard to argue against her quality. Her towering stature and aerial ability also make her a goal threat; she scored eight times for Lyon last season and has three already this time around domestically. She led her club to another Champions League title and remarkably has a hat-trick in the competition already this season, against Ryazan in the first round. At the World Cup Renard became France's go-to scorer, finding the net three times in the group stage, again against USA in the quarter-finals, with a bizarre own goal against Norway the only blot on her copybook.

In a Lyon team full of stars, Le Sommer continues to be one of the most important. Thirteen goals last season and five already by late November this term show she has lost none of her ability whether playing up front or on the left to accommodate her teammate Ada Hegerberg. She added yet another Champions League medal to her haul and would have had dreams of a World Cup medal on home soil, but it was not to be. Still, her contribution was felt as France reached the quarter-finals. She scored their opening goal of the tournament against South Korea and followed that up with a goal against Norway. Le Sommer recently found the net in six consecutive games for club and country and it's no wonder she has become the top scorer in Lyon's history and now sits only five goals behind Marinette Pichon's record of 81 for the national team.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Tenacious, combative and strong in the tackle, Ertz is the ideal midfielder and does the dirty work necessary for any successful side.

It was a huge shame for one of the world's best players but she hasn't let it affect her club form. Since the summer, Marozsán's numbers are staggering.

She was the most consistent striker at the tournament, scoring in five of England's seven games and having a further two goals disallowed in the semi-final and third-place play-off defeats. Her six goals tied her with Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan but injury marred the start of her domestic campaign.

Oddly, the Netherlands No 1 often found herself on the bench for Arsenal during their title-winning campaign and switched England for Spain and Atlético Madrid in the summer. Van Veenendaal's key contributions came in the summer as she did everything right to take her team to the World Cup final. She withstood pressure from Japan, kept a clean sheet against Italy and it is likely the Dutch would never have made the final had it not been for her save from Nilla Fischer's effort for Sweden in the semi.

When Majri is on her game she is simply unstoppable. A flying left-winger who often finds herself playing at full-back, Majri's pace and crossing ability bring her plenty of assists but she is not short of goals either. Three assists at the World Cup put her high in the rankings but her stats at club level as Lyon again dominated were as impressive as ever.

To become the star attacker in an all-star North Carolina Courage team says a lot for her ability but she needed consistency, which she added in abundance in 2019. Her year got off to a quiet start as she split duties between club and country and her World Cup was a quiet one, but it was after the tournament that her 2019 truly came alive. With skill, movement, pace and ability, Debinha went on a stunning run of form to lead the Courage to another NWSL championship. Nine goals after the World Cup, including strikes in both the NWSL semi-final and final, underlined her importance, while she also inspired Brazil with both goals in a friendly win against England.

Playing up front, Popp scored the opener and generally bullied England's defence in the recent friendly at Wembley and played a key role as ever in Wolfsburg's domestic success.

With her team making their World Cup bow, Endler likely knew she would be up against it in France but she was superb throughout, doing all she could to keep Sweden at bay for 83 minutes while a string of incredible saves against the USA gained her plenty of recognition.

At club level, Hermoso was in inspired form be it for Atlético Madrid or Barcelona. Hermoso scored 27 league goals in 2019 between the two sides, scoring three hat-tricks, one of which came on her Barcelona debut against CD Tacón.

Horan remained a consistent and vital performer for Portland Thorns as they again reached the NWSL play-offs but her World Cup was an odd one. Horan played all but half an hour in the group stage, finding the net against Thailand, but was left on the bench for the first two knockout games, against Spain and France. Horan returned and dictated the semi-final against England, sending in a superb diagonal ball for Alex Morgan to head home the second goal but did not feature at all in the final.

Four other goals for her country have left her agonisingly close to Wambach's tally while she found the net nine times for Portland Thorns for a third consecutive year.

Sauerbrunn missed the opening game of the World Cup, against Thailand, through injury but returned to play 90 minutes in each of their six games after that. The sight of Sauerbrunn on the floor with blood trickling down her face in the final summed up her indomitable attitude, her no-nonsense mentality and why the defender has been a mainstay in two World Cup-winning sides.

The 27-year-old has had to wait a while for a major chance with her country but she took it in 2019 and at the World Cup at times kept the superb Lindsey Horan out of the starting lineup. Mewis kept Horan on the bench for the second round, quarter-final and final, her energy and tenacity in midfield earning her the nod from Jill Ellis and she did not let her manager down. She returned to club duty in top form too, forming an impenetrable partnership with Denise O'Sullivan that was once again the foundation of the Courage's success.

Five of those goals came in the back half of the season as the pressure was ramped up and technically there are few better anywhere in the world than Nagasato.

Lloyd found the net eight times for a Sky Blue FC side still struggling for form and while she wasn't always a starter for the USA, she hit 16 goals throughout the year for her country, three of them coming at the World Cup, and has scored in six of her past seven international games.

Lindahl was superb for Sweden throughout the tournament, saving a penalty against Canada in the second round, thwarting Germany a round later and doing everything she could and more to stop the Netherlands in the semi-final.

Along with her teammate Kosovare Asllani, Jakobsson swapped France for Spain with CD Tacón, who will in 2020 become Real Madrid.

Her vision and passing ability couldn't help Bayern Munich topple Wolfsburg domestically but did play a major part in guiding them to the Champions League semi-finals. Magull was in good form at the World Cup, finding the net in the group stage before giving her side the lead in the quarter-final against Sweden, a match that ended in Germany's elimination. The Bayern team changed around her a lot over the summer but Magull is still performing at a high level and on the international stage scored a hat-trick in last month's Euro 2021 qualifier against Ukraine.

She is perhaps a victim of a year where the World Cup dominated but one of the finest – if not the finest – of the WSL's imports shows no sign of slowing down. With pace, movement, trickery and finishers all around her at Chelsea, Ji is still dominating games, creating endless chances and chipping in with goals for the side who have set the pace at the top of the league this season. Her year started with two goals to haul Chelsea back from 2-0 down against Manchester City before four goals in three games for South Korea set her up for the World Cup. Her nation underwhelmed in France but Ji has gone from strength to strength for Chelsea, her sublime free-kick against Lyon a highlight.

The creative forward ended a two-year spell in China to return home to Brazil and the move seemed to have the desired effect come the World Cup. With Brazil struggling for form heading into the tournament, Cristiane defied the critics to score a superb hat-trick in the opening win against Jamaica and put herself out front in the scoring charts early on in the tournament. While the next game would end in defeat, she also found the net against Australia and threatened to be the star of the tournament. But it ended in disappointment as she saw a header hit the crossbar in the defeat to France before going off injured in extra-time.

Thanks to her lack of international action, Short was a constant presence in the Chicago Red Stars team that reached the NWSL final. With 48 clearances, 32 interceptions and even a couple of goals, the left-back showed herself to be one of the best full-backs in the world this year. She was involved with the USA during Jill Ellis's final games in charge but played all bar eight minutes in Vlatko Andonovski's first two games at the helm and it seems Short may finally get the recognition she deserves on the world stage in 2020.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

She was a constant presence in the team throughout the year, from the SheBelieves Cup to recent friendlies under the new head coach, Vlatko Andonovski. Her ability to link attack and defence sets her apart and her importance to the team was again evident during their successful campaign in France. She will have been disappointed to have to come off at half-time on the biggest stage of all after sustaining a head injury during the first half of the final against the Netherlands, but it was only a minor blot on another stellar year.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

One of the most gifted players in the Barcelona and Spain squads, Putellas marked her card for 2019 with five goals in four games at the end of 2018. She found the net another seven times before the end of the season and was a constant presence in the Spain midfield at the World Cup. Putellas has returned to Barcelona in fine form, finding the net five times already this season including both legs of their opening Champions League tie against Juventus. Left-footed predominantly, her ability to find space in midfield, link with the attack and often pop up on the edge of the box with a goal mark her out as a valuable player.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Understandably, she is no longer a starter every week but to think she played at the summer's World Cup 24 years after making her tournament debut in 1995 is truly incredible. Not only that but Formiga performed and played in big games, including Brazil's convincing win against Jamaica and their thriller against Australia. She started in the second-round match against France that ultimately ended their tournament and will be probably Formiga's final World Cup appearance. She's not ready to give up just yet though; a new contract at PSG means she'll play until she is at least 42.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Other keepers dominated the landscape in what was a great year for players between the posts, but the experienced Bouhaddi remains an important part of the all-conquering Lyon side that once again won the Division 1 Féminine and the Champions League. Bouhaddi has her critics but there's a reason she's been a mainstay of a dominant Lyon side for so long and remained France's No 1 during their home World Cup year. Her shot-stopping ability is up there with the best and while the risks she takes on the ball can sometimes get her into trouble, overall 2019 has been one of Bouhaddi's more solid years.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

O'Sullivan will never be the most prolific goalscorer but her role on the pitch is no less important. A combative presence in the Courage midfield, she is the heartbeat of Paul Riley's successful side. Her pass completion rate was close to 85% from more than 1,200 attempted passes and she made 34 interceptions during the course of the campaign. Unsurprisingly, O'Sullivan has also remained a regular and important part of the Republic of Ireland setup and, at 25, O'Sullivan may only now be reaching her peak.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

While the USA were winning gold in France, Williams scored in three consecutive league games for the Courage and followed that up with a spectacular hat-trick in a 6-0 win away at closest rivals Portland Thorns. A true finisher with pace and movement, Williams has always struggled to gain a true foothold in the USA squad but she will take plenty of confidence in 2020 from her recent call-ups under new head coach, Vlatko Andonovski. Her two goals in a 6-0 win over Costa Rica will certainly help and maybe 2020 and the Tokyo Olympics will be where the world really gets to see more of Williams.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Her form for Freiburg and incredible talent earned her a move to Bayern Munich for the new season but it was for Germany at the World Cup where people got a really good look at just how good Gwinn can be. Eight goals last season for Freiburg illustrated her attacking potency but her stunning strike against China really announced her to the world.

Able to play across the front line or create from deeper, Reiten helped LSK dominate in Norway and she has wasted no time in bringing her quality to the WSL. Her form at the start of the year included a run of 12 goals in 10 games in the Toppserien and she then struck in Norway's opening game of the World Cup against Nigeria. Part of an exciting attack at international level, Reiten has the teammates to bring out the best in her and it will be fascinating to see how she links up with Sam Kerr in 2020.

The move did wonders for the tricky forward and despite a difficult season for the club as a whole, Blackstenius found the net nine times and took her extra confidence into the summer's World Cup. She didn't find the net as Sweden eased through the group but made a huge impact after that. Her goal against Canada in the second round was decisive before her finish against Germany in the quarter-finals sent Sweden into the final four and the former world champions home.

The heartbeat of a progressing Japan side, her nation's priorities were perhaps elsewhere this year with a home Olympics on the horizon, but Iwabuchi has firmly cemented her status as one of the team's stars. She scored a vital goal against Scotland in France, which helped Japan progress to the second round and a dazzling recent performance against Canada in a friendly showed what she is capable of. Her dribbling ability was demonstrated in a recent Nadeshiko League game where she beat two defenders before firing a low effort into the corner.

Engen did both those things in quick succession in 2019 but her ability to dictate and provide for an exciting attack at both club and international level should provide her with the perfect platform to continue developing. Engen helped put LSK on the path to another Toppserien title before joining Wolfsburg where she has quickly established herself as a first-team regular.

Barcelona are already on top in 2019 and a thumping 6-1 win over Atlético was a statement of intent, but for León it is about growing as a player. She has picked up five bookings this year and a red card against Juventus but her no-nonsense approach has made her a fine centre-back.

Her international year took a severe dip when she was surprisingly left out of the World Cup squad but Katoto did not let that affect her club form.

It could not have started any better as her two goals helped Chelsea come from behind to beat Arsenal. Cuthbert continued to score big goals as she found the net in the Champions League at home to PSG before a superb half-volley brought her that rarity, a goal by visitors at Lyon. She was in fine form for her country too, scoring in several World Cup warm-up games before finding the net in France in a thriller against Argentina. A driving force from midfield with bags of energy and tenacity, Cuthbert has plenty more to give but at only 21 there's plenty of time for the rest of her talent to show itself.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Eriksson has remained a regular in the starting line-ups for both Chelsea and Sweden, helping her club to a Champions League semi-final and her country to a World Cup bronze medal. Eriksson played in every game of Sweden's run to the semi-finals and returned to her club to be named Chelsea's new captain after the retirement of Karen Carney. At left-back she continues to create chances with her accurate crossing and passing ability and there's no doubt now she's well established as one of the best all-round full-backs in the game.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Often overshadowed at club level by Vivianne Miedema, some stern conversations with the England head coach, Phil Neville, proved a turning point. Big goals against Brazil and Japan as the Lionesses won the SheBelieves Cup sparked Mead to hit top form in the closing stages of the season, earning her a World Cup spot where she was a regular. She broke the FA WSL assists record to help Arsenal win the title and created the most goals for England at the World Cup too.

With her international career behind her, Boquete was free to focus fully on club duties but her performances and link-up play with the Royals attack couldn't quite push Laura Harvey's side to the play-offs. She didn't find the net but her six assists and cutting passes through defences reminded everyone what Vero is and always has been capable of. Her pass completion rate was up near 80% for the season and if she sticks around for another year in the NWSL she'll no doubt be a key component of a team with big ambitions.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

There was plenty of talk about Shaw being the exciting new talent going into the World Cup and, while Jamaica struggled in a tough group, Shaw's talent was evident. She scored four goals in two games during Jamaica's warm-up friendlies and since going professional in Division 1 Féminine with Bordeaux, Shaw has rarely looked back. Nine goals already this season leave her trailing only Ada Hegerberg in the scoring charts and it does appear the world is really at her feet at 22.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Her goal at the last in Paris to send Chelsea into the Champions League semi-finals will live long in the memory but it's her ability on the ball, her calmness in possession and her all-round ability that stands out. Mjelde was as ever a vital part of a Norway team who excited plenty of people at the World Cup before returning to her club as a full-back in the new season. Mjelde though has taken to the role well and didn't shy away from taking a crucial recent penalty to earn three points against Manchester United.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Scoring against Thailand, Rolfö missed the semi-final through suspension but returned to start against England in the third-place play-off. Technically astute, Rolfö provided plenty of quality at club level too, her performances for Bayern Munich earning her a move to rivals and champions Wolfsburg in the summer. After a good run of form early in 2019 in which she scored in five consecutive games, Rolfö found the net three matches in a row last month as she settled into new surroundings.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

With a first child on the way, Schult will be taking a spell away from the game early in 2020 but she left her mark earlier in the year by again proving the reliable No 1 for Wolfsburg and helping her side to a league and cup double.

The keeper started every NWSL match this season, keeping clean sheets in nine of them and was named in the team of the month three times as well as the NWSL Best XI at the end of the campaign, a testament to her superb performances.

An absolute rock at the back and one of the most motivational captains around, Erceg is probably underrated compared to the top names playing for a country that do not often challenge the top sides, but her partnership at club level with Abby Dahlkemper has often been impenetrable. Her defensive stats for the NWSL season tell their own story but aside from being a solid defender, Erceg is comfortable playing out from the back.

She'll hit 70 senior international caps at the start of 2020 despite having never played the game professionally, though that will soon change as she comes to the end of her time with the UCLA Bruins. Whether she heads to Europe or goes into the NWSL draft remains to be seen, but this ball-playing midfielder has every chance of going all the way and once again showed her qualities on the world stage in France during the summer.

The teenager's energy and driving force from full-back makes her a vital component for both the Thorns and Matildas and it is why she is already a regular for both at such a young age. She played in all Australia's World Cup matches, claiming an assist on the way and returned to action in Portland only a week after Australia's second-round exit to Norway.

It was England's form for Chelsea that earned her that chance; she ended 2018 with a succession of braces in the Women's Super League, and didn't look back this season. Her combination of technical ability with her power and strength at holding the ball up has made her a real all-round forward. England scored two hat-tricks towards the end of last season and currently has four in her last two, but her highlight came on the opening day when she curled in a superb effort in front of 24,000 fans at Stamford Bridge.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

She became even more of a regular for her country, starting against the USA in the World Cup semi-final and generally involved at some stage in most games throughout the year.

The 26-year-old has established herself as a first-team regular for both PSG and her national team. Her ability to get forward while remaining solid defensively has meant she has played as many games as anyone in 2019 and, apart from the USA game in which Peter Gerhardsson heavily rotated his side, Glas played 90 minutes-plus in every World Cup game, including the bronze-medal victory against England.

Playing for the back-to-back reigning NWSL champions North Carolina Courage, Hinkle was a regular for her side, playing in and starting 24 games throughout the year. Her ability to combine attack with defence makes her stand out and Hinkle contributed six assists this season. With a national team career not on the horizon owing to controversial views on same-sex marriage, she has been able to help her team to another title while others around the league were often on international duty and at 26 Hinkle is now coming into her peak years and has the impressive form to go with it.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Still Portugal's finest, Neto didn't find the net from her midfield role during her first 12 months at Wolfsburg but recently has started to add more goals to her game. She has scored five times since the start of the season with three of them coming in the team's Champions League campaign, while she also found the net for Portugal in a recent Euro 2021 qualifier against Finland. Her ability to control games shows why Wolfsburg were so keen to sign her but it's a real shame we may not get to see Neto's quality on the world stage too often because she continues to be one of the most underrated players around.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Between club and country she found the net in six consecutive matches in March and April and was often trusted by Corinne Diacre to lead the line at her home World Cup. Gauvin scored big goals in big games against Norway and Brazil and is already in fine form during the new Division 1 Féminine season, finding the net five times in her last three league outings, including an impressive hat-trick against Paris FC. A combative striker, Gauvin will get better if she adds consistency to her game.","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

The 17-year-old Oberdorf scored five goals in two games a year ago for SGS Essen and hasn't looked back since. A technical midfielder, Oberdorf only made her senior Germany debut in April but ended up going to the World Cup in the summer. Not only that, the teenager played in all five of their games in France and scored her first international goal in a Euro 2021 qualifier in Ukraine in September. With so far to go before she reaches her peak, it is likely this won't be the last time Oberdorf features in such a list. ","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Ludmila hit form at the start of the year, scoring twice to knock Barcelona out of the Spanish Cup. Her form earned her a starting spot in all four of Brazil's World Cup matches before returning to Spain where she has had a solid if unspectacular start to the campaign. At 25, Ludmila has the ability to become something special and just needs to add more frequent goals and assists to her game. ","","","","","","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"
