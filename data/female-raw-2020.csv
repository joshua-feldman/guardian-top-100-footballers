It’s hard to argue with too. With 12 goals from December on, including five after the Bundesliga restarted, she was again the key influence in Wolfsburg’s title defence and her stunning four-goal haul against Glasgow City in the Champions League quarter-final helped push her side towards another final. It didn’t end in the way she would have wanted before making a move to Chelsea for a world record transfer fee, just after being named women’s footballer of the year in Germany. Also named Uefa’s player of the year, Harder found the net five times for Denmark and had already hit the mark twice in Chelsea blue by the start of December. Aside from her goals, no player in Europe created more chances than Harder this year, making her the ultimate all-round forward and once more the best player in the world.","RL","","","JA","TD","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

The Arsenal striker is a goalscoring and assist machine. Not only did she win the Golden Boot in the WSL last season but she also recorded the most assists, extraordinary for someone so well-known for her finishing skills. Her performance early in the year in which she scored six and created four in an 11-1 Arsenal win over Bristol City was the best individual performance the league has seen, and she has shown no signs of slowing down. The fact she raced to 10 goals in only seven league games at the start of this season should be seen as ridiculously impressive, but it has just become standard now for Miedema. Her movement, touch and sixth sense to be in the right place at the right time makes what she does look easy when it’s anything but.

She returned to the WSL to rejoin Manchester City, but not before sealing another treble and a third Champions League title with Lyon. While some perhaps think Bronze is no longer hitting the ridiculously high standards of a few years ago, her attacking stats say differently. Her agility and athleticism make her the ideal full-back and no one in her position recorded more assists throughout 2020, while she’s remained a more than solid defender. She has had to adapt to a new way of playing since returning home, but her marauding run to score against Bristol City was more than familiar to those who watched her in the league before her switch to Lyon.

Renard was named the Champions League defender of the season and not only is she a rock at the back, with her imposing stature making for the ideal centre-back, she is also more than composed on the ball and uses her qualities to pose an attacking threat too. She is tied for the most shots on target anywhere in the world for a centre-back throughout the year, and with four goals and two assists by the start of December this season, her stats would make you think she was a forward rather than a defender. She also has a knack for popping up at big moments, such as scoring the winner against PSG in the Champions League semi-final.

Her goals this year have made a big contribution to Lyon’s dominance in 2020 and her performances in Europe led to her being named the Champions League midfielder of the season. The fact her assists stats are even more impressive show she has it all in an attacking sense. Marozsán ended last season with 13 assists and by the start of December already had three goals and three assists in the new season. Unsurprisingly, she ranked in the top three central midfielders throughout the year for chances created and she appears to be getting better and better. With the calmness of the more defensive duo of Amandine Henry and Saki Kumagai behind, Marozsán has the licence to go and unpick the defences trying to stop the unstoppable Lyon force.","RL","","","JA","TD","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

She doesn’t often get the plaudits that go to some of Lyon’s more attacking players, but her role within the team is vital. Henry has never been about scoring goals, although she has already scored a couple this season, but about dictating games with the tempo she sets in midfield. Her ability to read games and find the space that allows her to find her teammates in attacking positions is crucial to how Lyon play and without Henry they are a poorer team. Henry is never rushed, her intelligence means she always has the time to play the way she wants. With another treble behind her, she’s also fast becoming one of the most decorated players in the game.","RL","","","JA","TD","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

Since Chelsea’s return to action she has taken on a more creative role, and as of November no player had created more chances in the WSL this season. While she will have been disappointed with some missed chances, Kerr scored three times in the WSL early on in the campaign and looks to be adapting to the slightly different role Emma Hayes has given her.

With nine assists last season, Graham Hansen created six goals in her first six league games this season, putting her well on target to improve on her 2019-20 tally. More than capable of chipping in with goals for club and country, she has created more chances than any other player bar Pernille Harder in 2020.

She is now up there as one of the best in the world for her tackling and her ability to win the ball back with her energy and agility. Few have perfected the art of the defensive midfield role like Ertz as, while she is capable of playing centre-back and still does on occasion.

There’s so much more to come from the 23-year-old but she’s already one of the most dangerous wingers on the planet. No one in 2020 has completed more dribbles than Cascarino and her talent was evident in the Champions League final against Wolfsburg, where she was a constant threat and created several clear chances for her teammates. By the start of December she already had six assists in the French league this season.

Whether it’s interceptions, duels, recoveries or her pass completion, Kumagai ranks highly for just about everything, and her performance in the Champions League final was a joy to behold.

With Hegerberg out injured, Le Sommer started the new season with three goals for her club and seven more for her national team, including a four-goal haul in a recent qualifier against North Macedonia.

Her goal in the Champions League final was not enough to topple an unstoppable Lyon side, but Popp’s eye for goal is just an added bonus. She has a real match intelligence of where to be on the pitch and when. As a player who can combine striker duties with being in midfield, Popp knows when to sit deep and when to attack the box.

With pace to burn, Katoto is already well on her way to scoring double figures for a fourth consecutive season after only nine games. Eight goals at the start of the year and another eight in nine games at the start of this season puts her up there with the best forwards in the world, her recent strike for PSG that condemned Lyon to a rare defeat the highlight.

She also grabbed both goals, including a stoppage-time winner, when Chelsea won the Continental Cup final.

She was also a creative influence, ending last season high up in the assist rankings for the WSL while with the Netherlands she has continued to contribute consistently, scoring three times in three recent Euro 2021 qualifiers as her country booked their spot in England with the hope of defending their title.

It looks as if Groenen has more licence to get forward for United and has often been seen dribbling into the box and trying to unlock opposition defences, and her passing ability has often been a creative key for a new-look attack.

She’s already bettered her tally of 10 goals from last season in a devastating start to the new campaign, which included four goals against Fleury and a hat-trick against Dijon.

She already had seven goals in six games in France by the start of December, albeit with six coming in an incredible blitz in one league game against Issy.

Seven goals in the back half of last season have been bettered already this season, where Freigang’s 10 goals in 10 games for Eintracht Frankfurt put her at the top of the goalscoring charts in the Bundesliga at the beginning of December. It’s been a good year on the international stage too, Freigang making her senior Germany debut in March and making her mark last month with a hat-trick against Greece in a Euro 2022 qualifier.

Hammarlund’s 12 goals made her the second top scorer in Sweden this year, with five assists on top of that ensuring she was named Damallsvenskan forward of the year. Her movement inside the box has set her apart, always finding room to put her finishing ability into action. In Göteborg’s final game of the season, she scored once and set up three other goals in a stunning 7-0 win over rivals Linköping.","RL","100","","JA","TD","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"

The Malawi international has taken the Chinese Women’s Super League by storm and was once again one of the top scorers this year, scoring seven for Jiangsu Suning, helping them into the Championship play-offs where they suffered defeat to rivals Wuhan. For Malawi, Chawinga was once again the star of the show, scoring seven in the recent Cosafa championships as Malawi reached the semi-finals before defeat to South Africa. Her six-goal haul against Lesotho marked her down as the one of the top African goalscorers.","RL","100","","JA","TD","header-image-day-1_alligator.png"
