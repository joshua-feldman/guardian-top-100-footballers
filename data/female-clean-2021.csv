The Barcelona and Spain midfielder has been on top of the game and risen to the top with it. She has produced almost unfathomable numbers for club and country in terms of goals and assists, as well as being a key component of Barça’s success throughout the year, in which the Catalan club secured a treble and a first Champions League title. Putellas's ability to create, score and run games has enabled her to stand out even in a team of superstars and in our vote she was almost 300 points clear of second place, with more than half our judges voting her their No 1."

Miedema continued to push the boundaries in 2021 and to break records with it; she is now out on her own as the top scorer in the history of the Women’s Super League. Miedema has continued to show she can also be a creative force for club and country, not just a scorer. She won the Golden Boot at the Tokyo Olympics during the summer with a remarkable 10 goals in four games, including two against the world champions, USA, in a thrilling quarter-final."

Now firmly established as one of the world’s best, Kerr toppled Vivianne Miedema as the Golden Boot winner in the Women’s Super League last season and leads the way again this term, thanks in no small part to her connection with strike partner Fran Kirby. Kerr’s goals helped Chelsea to another domestic double as well as a first Champions League final while she continued to be in fine form for her national team too, scoring six goals for Australia in Tokyo, a tally beaten only by Miedema."

While the Norwegian superstar scores her fair share of goals, she has undoubtedly become known as one of the most creative players anywhere and her first appearance in the top five only backs up what an incredible year she has had. Graham Hansen has surpassed the 40-goal mark for Norway and, playing as an inside forward for Barcelona, she played a huge part in her team’s success throughout 2021."

Since the summer though it has been a different story: she has become more at home in a Chelsea side now playing around Harder’s strengths, and her superb solo goal against Manchester United in September illustrated what she brings to her team. Between club and country, she has scored in seven of her 10 games so far this season at the time of writing."

It is a testament to Barcelona that despite her high ranking two of her clubmates are still above her in our list. Hermoso ended last season at the top of the Primera Iberdrola scoring charts, the only player to score more than 30 goals, while she also registered 14 assists and ended the campaign as joint top scorer in the Champions League too. It’s hard to look past stats such as that when discussing strikers and Hermoso’s contributions this year put her right up there with the very best."

Her partnership with Sam Kerr has made Chelsea almost unstoppable and her individual numbers have been incredible, despite Kerr taking the Golden Boot at the end of last season. Kirby’s movement, ingenuity and footwork make her a nightmare for most defenders and she has returned to the pitch in prime form at a time when England will need her at her best going into a home European Championship."

And it is no coincidence that Paredes has played for two of Europe’s top teams in 2021. The Spain captain helped lead Paris Saint-Germain to a long-awaited league title before making a return to Spain and Barcelona in the summer, where she has only added to an already solid back line and formed a fantastic partnership with her fellow national team centre-back Mapi León."

She was approaching double figures once again by November for the all-conquering Spanish side. Her two goals in the Champions League semi-final second leg against PSG were among the standout moments of the year, and were followed by four goals for her national team at the Tokyo Olympics. Martens has been back at her best this year."
10,"93","83","Aitana Bonmati","Midfielder","Barcelona","Primera Iberdrola",23,"Spain","https://media.guim.co.uk/d087541f069763a946bea4241e6c5402f2bc65fa/1468_0_1163_1163/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/305a9bf451b8b3ee8d6f130b09bd2ae0fa71fb85/0_36_4409_2646/500.jpg","The 23-year-old has blossomed into a top player this year and a steep rise in the rankings reflects that. Worryingly for her opponents, the midfielder is still nowhere near her peak and it would be no surprise to see her further up this list in the future. Bonmati has been a source of goals and assists for club and country but her talent goes far beyond that, her ability to link play and see passes others cannot has allowed the Barcelona attack in front of her to flourish. Her player of the match performance – and goal – in the Champions League final demonstrated what she can do on the biggest stage."
11,"25","14","Magdalena Eriksson","Defender","Chelsea","Barclays FA Women's Super League",28,"Sweden","https://media.guim.co.uk/d1fdc18c42fc649b90d4062aef86d9ea26d0642a/438_136_914_914/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/9cdd344112603314fe2682af0eacc91f8324b95e/0_239_5220_3131/500.jpg","The influential Chelsea captain led her side through another successful year on the pitch. The 28-year-old has become one of the ultimate modern defenders, with an ability to play out from the back while remaining a solid presence at the heart of the defence for both Chelsea and Sweden. Her 2021 was full of success, as she took home Continental Cup and Women’s Super League medals, as well as winning a silver medal with Sweden and it could have easily been gold to go with her domestic triumphs."

Her rock-solid presence between the posts helped PSG to a historic league title. Her last-minute save that knocked Lyon out of the Champions League was one of the most important saves of the year from any goalkeeper and big performances have become standard now for someone who has established herself as the No 1 of No 1s in recent years."
13,"20","7","Marie-Antoinette Katoto","Forward","PSG","D1 Arkema",23,"France","https://media.guim.co.uk/90046d8f5c81392480e7b36e8f2d20f988b2d316/542_90_718_717/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/cad89bab3ff94c95ee1b8604c09d39ec4a2d5d76/0_239_3275_1965/500.jpg","Katoto is well on her way to becoming one of the best strikers in the world at the age of only 23. Katoto took her game up another level in 2021 and not only has the stats but now the silverware to show for it. Her 21 goals come the end of last season saw her well clear of anyone else (other than Khadija Shaw) in Division 1 Arkema and played a huge part in PSG finally prising away the league title from Lyon. Katoto has become the attack leader for both PSG and France, already leads the scoring charts domestically this season and has nine goals in France’s first six World Cup qualifiers."
14,"70","56","Ashley Lawrence","Defender","PSG","D1 Arkema",26,"Canada","https://media.guim.co.uk/721d5ad7c7e57e5b88bd47a47a9dd8a82a32fc42/2307_17_842_841/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/e39c4314a7c0309f8a669991e69edd803d398e55/227_239_3271_1963/500.jpg","What a year at both domestic and international level for a player who has perhaps gone under the radar in the past, but not this year as Lawrence flies up the rankings for 2021. Whether it’s been at left-back, centre-back or in midfield, Lawrence’s versatility is only one trait that stands her apart, but her ability to shine in all of them means it’s no coincidence she won major tournaments with both PSG and Canada this year. Topping Lyon domestically was followed up with a gold medal in Tokyo."
15,"4","-11","Wendie Renard","Defender","Lyon","D1 Arkema",31,"France","https://media.guim.co.uk/15199742c5ed1fcb0d58bb1b976bb5d8faf82dbf/864_172_938_938/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/e91022a52a9615eef7a3ad56e16f80981fddea1f/0_16_1108_664/500.jpg","The Lyon and France leader continues to be one of the most imposing defenders in the game but drops out of our top 10 in 2021. Renard started the year on an incredible run of scoring in five consecutive games and there are few players anywhere who offer the aerial threat of the centre-back. Lyon did not enjoy their usual success this year but Renard forged a fine partnership with Kadeisha Buchanan in the continued absence of Griedge Mbock and overall enjoyed another solid calendar year."

Whether it’s her ability to play out from the back or help her team keep clean sheets, Mapi has it all and her new partnership with international teammate Irene Paredes at Barcelona has only helped Europe’s top club to new heights. Her consistent performances at the heart of the defence helped her side to a historic treble in 2021 and at 26 there’s time for Mapi to get even better."

Her two-goal display in an opening win against the USA was a huge moment for the striker and she followed that up with three more goals, including one against Canada in the final. Blackstenius is fast becoming one of the most well-rounded forwards in the game and she scored an impressive 17 goals in 21 games for Häcken in this year’s Damallsvenskan."

The 38-year-old has been a mainstay for Canada for so long now and finally got her hands on a gold medal at perhaps the final time of asking. She also helped Portland Thorns to the NWSL Shield in what has been a successful year on a personal level for the great forward, who consistently chipped in with goals and assists for her club."

She has appeared rejuvenated under the new Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, and showed her talent on the world stage representing Team GB over the summer, where she slotted into a side made up of primarily English players as if she had been with them all her life. There are still very few who display the game intelligence Little does and she is now right back in the goals too."

Mewis went on to end her season in Manchester as one of the best in the league and her five goals in Europe made her joint-second in the rankings. Six goals through the year for the USA, including one at the Olympics, was a solid return for a player who sadly missed much of the second half of 2021 after requiring surgery upon returning to North Carolina."

While the Barcelona centre-back pairing is well-known and the team’s attack has dominated Europe this year, Paños has played a more than valuable role between the posts and has established herself as Spain’s No 1. Last season, Paños conceded only 17 goals in 32 matches and did not concede in the league until December 2020, a remarkable feat. She made a big penalty save against Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-finals and went on to keep a clean sheet in the final."

While Kirby and Kerr take most of the plaudits for their connection, it’s uncanny how many of their goals are started by Ji’s ability to dictate in midfield. Still capable of a killer assist, as she showed recently against Aston Villa, the Fifa Best nominee is still at the top of her game."

Her presence for PSG was sorely missed in the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona.

She had offered a warning sign of what to expect with a dominant performance against the world champions, USA, and showed that she is still at the top of her game, while playing a valuable role for Real Madrid too. Sadly, a positive Covid-19 test and subsequent ligament injury have meant we haven’t seen too much of the Swede since the summer."

White’s position in the rankings this year though will owe much to the six goals she scored for Team GB in Tokyo, where a hat-trick against Australia would have almost single-handedly dragged her side into the semi-finals had it not been for a late collapse.

One of the most creative players in Europe, Magull is at the source of many attacks for both her country and Bayern Munich, her five goals and six assists one of the key reasons Jens Scheuer’s side were finally able to end Wolfsburg’s dominance in Germany. A fine year from a fine player who continues to improve."

Debinha hit double figures for Brazil over the past 12 months, with goals in the SheBelieves Cup and at the Tokyo Olympics. At club level she started the year in fine form, ending the NWSL Challenge Cup as the top scorer and scored another three in the regular season despite North Carolina Courage having a below-par season by their usual standards. She remains one of the best in her position anywhere in the world."

While solid at the back, Buchanan likes to break out from defence and link with her midfield and attack and is more than comfortable going for goal, as a recent stunning volley against Guingamp in France showed.

She didn’t always start in Barcelona’s treble-winning campaign but she is a major talent – composed on the ball and an important part of why the team works; the same goes for her role in the national team.

She has barely missed a minute since returning after the Olympics and remained a key part of the USA side too, scoring six goals from midfield in 2021. Often mesmerising with the ball at her feet, Lavelle is one of the easiest on the eye players to watch anywhere in the world and there are few who get around the pitch like her."

Not that she was in a slump before it, with four goals for Lyon at the end of last season. Her highlights though came in the US, with eight goals and three assists in her 18 appearances during her temporary stay.

She scored in the quarter-final shootout against Brazil, scored the decisive winner 15 minutes from time against the USA, and scored in both normal time and the shootout in the final against Sweden as Canada won gold.

What’s scary about her talent is she is already one of the best in her role at 19 years old. Her positional play combined with her endless energy makes her a tough defensive midfielder to play against and the fact she is nowhere near her peak years yet makes it all the more remarkable. There can be no doubt Oberdorf is well on the way to being one of the world’s best and Wolfsburg will be delighted to have tied her down on a deal until 2024 at the start of the year."

It’s testament to Rolfö’s attacking qualities she hasn’t looked out of place in Catalonia, scoring four goals in her opening 10 league games in Spain as well as creating several more. Her three goals in Tokyo also played a big role in Sweden’s march to the final and subsequent silver medal. Overall a really good year for Rolfö."

Her move to Lyon has added an extra layer to her game, while her ability to get forward from full-back is unmatched by many and she can often be found influencing games at the top end of the pitch, forging a good partnership with Delphine Cascarino on Lyon’s right flank. Her sending-off in Australia's Olympic semi-final defeat by Sweden was a low moment for a player still very young but there’s no doubt she’s still on the way to a top-level career."

Banda may well be the first player to score back-to-back Olympic hat-tricks and not win either game, but her six-goal haul against European champions Netherlands and again in a thrilling 4-4 draw with China were two of the moments of the year.

At 31, the attacking defender is one of the most experienced heads in a successful Barcelona side and she still has a huge influence on the team at both ends of the pitch. A club legend, she made her 300th club appearance for the Catalans this year.

The defensive midfielder has established herself as one of the best in her position, an ability to spot a pass to those ahead which helps unlock Arsenal’s threat level up front like very few others. She deservedly rises slightly in the rankings this year. Wälti can control games with ease and has kept her role in the Arsenal team since the arrival of new coach Jonas Eidevall."

No one contributed more goals to the USA throughout the year as Lloyd hit double figures, including two in the Olympic bronze-medal match against Australia to round off her last major tournament.

The talented 21-year-old is already showing composure in front of goal beyond her years for one of Europe’s top teams, while scoring her first goals for her country at the end of October in a World Cup qualifier.

Roord has five goals in her opening nine league games for Wolfsburg, two more in the Champions League, while a recent hat-trick for the Netherlands only emphasised her return to scoring form.

For Rosengård, Seger was a constant in midfield as the club won back their domestic league title, while she was still a regular for a star-studded Sweden side, which says everything about what she still has to offer coming towards the back end of her career.

Bonansea’s close control, vision and eye for goal has always made her one of the best players to come out of Italy and at 30 she’s showing no signs of slowing down. She has transferred her good form to the Italy national team and will be one to watch at next summer’s European Championships."
86,"52","-34","Sakina Karchaoui","Defender","PSG","D1 Arkema",25,"France","https://media.guim.co.uk/1521d4f865b13343efa7f38b64143f34e41b8a26/607_176_831_830/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/d3193ea32a78796a5970c0fbb4ab7ab0900cee90/0_84_3526_2117/500.jpg","While several players swapped PSG for Lyon over the summer, Karchaoui went the other way, opting to join the French champions rather than leave them. The left-back is now in the prime years of her career and performing consistently, holding down the position for her national team. Her talent is illustrated by the calibre of clubs that have chased her before two big moves in consecutive summers. With her ability to get forward and influence attacks, Karchaoui enjoyed another solid year overall."
87,NA,"New entry","Catarina Macario","Forward","Lyon","D1 Arkema",22,"USA","https://media.guim.co.uk/c90bd69953ee4f6a4d1d0e4e5ca60eaf85b921cf/1984_212_1184_1185/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/8d234c6bc71fb8f0e0649be2f8f2ce243d30ccc2/0_121_3444_2066/500.jpg","How one of the USA’s brightest prospects got on at one of Europe’s top sides was always going to be an intriguing 2021 storyline, and Macario did not disappoint. Five goals in seven for Lyon last season has been followed up by seven already this season where she sits as the second top scorer in the league, adding to her three in the Champions League. Macario also got off the mark for her national team in a year that couldn’t have gone much better for the 22-year-old who took full advantage of key Lyon attackers being out through injury or departing for new adventures."
88,NA,"New entry","Lina Hurtig","Forward","Juventus","Serie A TIMvision",26,"Sweden","https://media.guim.co.uk/a3da0100b9edaedb130c7a078488716ff74ece3a/1158_132_1932_1932/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/f7c445e8284e77af0c93a8df323c776209b60dca/0_52_2063_1238/500.jpg","After joining Juventus at the back end of 2020 off a successful Damallsvenskan season, Hurtig wasted no time in settling into her new environment, scoring six goals in her debut Serie A campaign for the Old Lady. Hurtig also hit seven for Sweden, the imposing centre-forward enjoying a good year during which her most memorable contributions came in Tokyo, scoring first in a dominant 3-0 win over the USA before finding the net again against Australia. A first appearance in the 100 and probably not the last."
89,NA,"New entry","Paulina Dudek","Defender","PSG","D1 Arkema",24,"Poland","https://media.guim.co.uk/85ccb17289f69d7d5023bdfe8691fcdfd65a7d39/2000_471_1800_1801/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/9161d9a97e2ef3e3afb5d31f4fef7ecf4122c0b7/296_501_3479_2088/500.jpg","Dudek has so often come so close to making the 100 and this year finally, and deservedly, breaks into the rankings. The Poland international perhaps goes unnoticed compared to some of the bigger names in the PSG defence, but to play such a key role in their title success proves what a top-class defender Dudek has become. Her stats this year set her apart from most defenders and it most certainly won’t be the last time she makes the 100, her composure on the ball and no-nonsense defending making her a classic modern defender."

Daly’s all-action style was once again prevalent, showing a do-or-die attitude for her team and, with Lucy Bronze injured, Daly continued to hold down her familiar right-back role for England."
91,"80","-11","Sydney Lohmann","Midfielder","Bayern Munich","FLYERALARM Frauen-Bundesliga",21,"Germany","https://media.guim.co.uk/4e9f08728a8bca8acf15aadb491cb9b11bae3cd1/989_225_1826_1826/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/75e61b38d1d0dfb6c76a113e5feccae357e96dc3/0_186_3471_2082/500.jpg","Lohmann is one of many players who would have probably claimed a higher ranking had it not been for injuries. One of the breakout stars of 2020, Lohmann took that form into 2021 and played a commanding midfield role in what turned out to be an ultimately successful year for Bayern Munich. Now a key member of the Germany team, Lohmann had to have hip surgery a few months ago but should still return at the top of her game."
92,NA,"New entry","Midge Purce","Forward","NJ/NY Gotham","NWSL",26,"USA","https://media.guim.co.uk/102f0c7dd2d662254711f092fdde3842ad399304/1774_140_1271_1271/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/2e4c3ece0a290bd07998d7617a7018a875027e56/78_164_1524_914/500.jpg","Another player who enjoyed a breakout campaign in the NWSL this year. Purce was inspired throughout 2021, ending the regular season as the joint-second top scorer in the league with nine goals and playing a huge part in helping NJ/NY Gotham into the end of season play-offs with her direct play and eye for goal. Purce was a nightmare to play against for any NWSL side and earned a place in the NWSL best XI as a reward for her fine form."
93,"9","-84","Julie Ertz","Midfielder","Chicago Red Stars","NWSL",29,"USA","https://media.guim.co.uk/ebe81b054a0a55dab9b32d26114d4908db8eebef/573_110_833_832/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/5ac770505557625f61664bae0734f0614bc5695c/0_0_3871_2322/500.jpg","Ertz suffers a significant drop in the rankings but, given the injury problems she has faced this year, it says a lot about how she is viewed around the world that she makes the 100 again. While her club season was almost nonexistent, Ertz did remain a regular for the USA all the way up to and including the Olympics, where her presence was missed in the opening 45 minutes of their first game, against Sweden. The US became a more solid prospect after her return and the all-energy midfielder helped her side to bronze but sadly she has not played since."
94,NA,"New entry","Vanessa Gilles","Defender","Bordeaux","D1 Arkema",25,"Canada","https://media.guim.co.uk/b15f371ee90e78813c8aefa6fbff0b460f3be1b3/1057_54_1103_1103/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/44f402c1d7aa5eb338351a07c274fd8f6eb8baff/0_282_5472_3283/500.jpg","Gilles makes our list for the first time and is probably one of 2021's most understated and underrated performers. While all eyes focused on some of Canada’s bigger names when they won gold in Tokyo, the solid centre-back was one of their standout performers throughout the tournament, forging a brilliant partnership with Kadeisha Buchanan. It would have been cruel had her penalty miss in the final shootout been costly because few deserved a gold medal more and Gilles will no doubt continue to gain more recognition in future years."
95,NA,"New entry","Trinity Rodman","Forward","Washington Spirit","NWSL",19,"USA","https://media.guim.co.uk/6dca30d3302ed15942fa8cf30d57ba126953867c/365_116_1215_1215/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/2daf3e8626113c55181c767051e3ca08ed1b37b0/0_239_3765_2260/500.jpg","Arguably the breakout star of 2021 having come straight out of the NWSL draft and, while still a teenager, imposing herself on the league, ending the season with six goals, five assists and an NWSL trophy as Washington Spirit won the championship for the first time. Rodman, daughter of the former NBA player Dennis, scored in the semi-final and played a vital part in the final and it looks as though the sky is the limit for a highly promising young player."
96,NA,"New entry","Kheira Hamraoui","Midfielder","PSG","D1 Arkema",31,"France","https://media.guim.co.uk/a1f35e7b84e307119085e16364cdf1b2850918c1/788_23_785_785/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/2c2ef9ccdd721eb427e787dad000173a429d7a1d/0_51_1958_1175/500.jpg","The experienced French midfielder wasn’t always a regular starter for Barcelona, but she played an important part in the team’s success in 2021. Hamraoui was called upon to start the Champions League final against Chelsea and put in a solid performance, one of her last contributions before returning to France with PSG where she became a regular starter and key performer for the French champions. Her importance to two of 2021's most successful sides tells its own story, though her year ended on a traumatic note when she was violently assaulted by two masked assailants in November."
97,NA,"Re-entry","Mal Pugh","Forward","Chicago Red Stars","NWSL",23,"USA","https://media.guim.co.uk/f0141190ea902961b0f4ea4207ed348efc6ebaab/1822_134_2358_2358/500.jpg","https://media.guim.co.uk/c2663450ea2685a003f2cb7272cabde73c6c57bd/728_216_2434_1460/500.jpg","Pugh returns to the 100 after a year in which she helped the Red Stars reach the NWSL final, with four assists setting her apart as one of the league’s most creative players. With pace to burn, Pugh is continuing to add end product to her game, her goal in the first play-off round against Gotham was pivotal and her place in the second best XI in the NWSL awards illustrated her contribution on the field in Chicago throughout 2021."

Parris ended the season with 13 goals before joining Arsenal where she got off to a good start with two goals in Champions League qualifying. It has not happened in front of goal for the hard-working Parris more recently but she is quickly becoming an important part of Jonas Eidevall’s plans."

Strong and imposing, Bright offers a tough presence at the back for club and country and was given the honour of captaining England for the first time in November, showing at 28 she is also now ready to take on a leadership role at the top level."

Kelly had stepped up to City's level better than anyone could have imagined, scoring 10 goals and registering 11 assists in the Women's Super League before her injury. Her pace, skill and end product set her apart – that she still squeezes into the list despite not having played since May is testament to that."
