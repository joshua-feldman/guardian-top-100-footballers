De Bruyne assisted eight goals for Pep Guardiola’s team as they went about securing a fourth championship in five years and already had a further 10 this campaign prior to the World Cup.

His 16 goals and 15 assists so far have seen him shine in Christophe Galtier’s new-look side.

It remains to be seen whether he can recapture that form for PSG in the new year, but he remains as exciting a young full-back as there is in the game. Able to affect play going forward as well as any full-back in the game, even if he is sometimes lacking in his positioning, his recovery pace and the threat he poses going forward makes him perfectly adept at pinning back opposing wingers – an archetypal modern full-back.","Eric Devin","","","day_4_scalpel.jpg"

But James was also dogged by injuries, the most devastating of which was the knee injury he sustained in the Champions League group victory away at Milan in October that resulted in the 23-year-old missing the World Cup. He returned for the Premier League win against Bournemouth at the end of the year but was subsequently struck down by the same problem in the second half of that game. A hugely talented player, clearly, but he falls 24 places on the list.","Sachin Nakrani","AR","PC","day_4_scalpel.jpg"

He struck 17 times in all competitions in 2021-22 and has gone along at almost a goal per start for Bayern this time around, often pushed into a striking role in a 4-4-2 by Julian Nagelsmann following Robert Lewandowski’s exit. His association with Germany’s World Cup failure has cost him, with Hansi Flick’s team undermined by repeatedly missing chances as well as defensive slip-ups. Having signed a lucrative new deal in 2022, Gnabry will continue to be influential for club and country.","Andy Brassell","AR","PC","day_4_scalpel.jpg"

The midfielder always thought his playing style aligned closer to Gennaro Gattuso but his manager, Stefano Pioli, sees shades of Daniele De Rossi in there too. Everyone can at least agree now that Tonali has flourished with the Rossoneri, playing his way into a starting position last season even when that meant breaking up the established partnership of Franck Kessié and Ismaël Bennacer. He scored crucial goals away at Lazio and Verona in the spring to keep Milan on course for the scudetto, and help earn himself a first appearance on this list.","Nicky Bandini","AR","PC","day_4_scalpel.jpg"

It was Robertson’s 54th assist in the English top flight – with 50 of them coming at Liverpool – and it meant he overtook Everton’s Leighton Baines at the top of the list. After the game Jürgen Klopp said: “I just remember the guy we bought from Hull. Offensively he was great, defensively not so good. Now he can do both.” His energy levels have dropped somewhat in 2022-23, along with the rest of the Liverpool team.","Marcus Christenson","AR","PC","day_4_scalpel.jpg"

His status at Bayern rose during 2022, having previously drawn the ire of Karl-Heinz Rummenigge for a perceived lack of defensive effort and Sané has been the subject of much fretting due to his colossal wages. On his day he looks like one of the world’s best, with his combination of pace, skill and finishing power, and he is having more of those days for Bayern than he did before. Even at the age of 27 it still feels as if he is on the outside looking in for Germany, taken to the World Cup but hardly used even in times of difficulty.","Andy Brassell","AR","PC","day_4_scalpel.jpg"

That goal made him the joint top Brazilian scorer in Libertadores history and, despite not making Tite’s World Cup squad, 29 goals in 2022 sees Barbosa sneak on to the list. While the prolific forward may not have lived up to the “next Neymar” hype, he cemented his place as a Flamengo legend and even inherited the hallowed No 10 shirt – not before seeking Zico’s approval, of course.","Tom Robinson","AR","PC","day_4_scalpel.jpg"

The former Manchester City defender started every game and played every minute in Qatar, the coach, Lionel Scaloni, sticking by him despite the opening defeat against Saudi Arabia. At club level Otamendi played an integral part as Benfica finished third in 2021-22. The club then went on to win their Champions League group ahead of PSG and Juventus. His coach, Roger Schmidt, is a fan and recently said the club are keen to extend the veteran’s contract.","Marcus Christenson","AR","PC","day_4_scalpel.jpg"
