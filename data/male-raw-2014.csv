It’s a blur of speed, gelled hair and fluorescent boots and perhaps the greatest part of it all is that this is a workaholic’s career.

He had hit the post 11 times, too, so that figure could be even higher, and he had provided 19 assists. He ends the year having just become the all-time leading scorer in La Liga and the all-time leading scorer in European competition. And that’s just for his club: he also took Argentina to the World Cup final. And yet most people have concluded that this was a bad year for Messi, which perhaps it was. It was certainly disappointing for his club, runners-up to Atlético Madrid in the league, Real Madrid in the cup and beaten by Atlético in the Champions League quarter-finals. The statistics really just hammer home the absurdly high standards Messi had set. It was a difficult season off the pitch as well as on it, with injury and tax issues, while Messi’s relationship with some on the board has been strained. Meanwhile his team fades too. In a way, maybe the surprise is that he played as well as he did, albeit still not well enough to top this chart. For some Messi is the best player of all time, but not the best player in the world in 2014: Messi slips off the top of the Guardian list for the first time.

But there is little doubt that the 28-year-old has set a new benchmark by adapting with particular brilliance to the modern demands on the position. His confidence, skill and pace allow him to come out of his area and effectively give his teams a 12th player on the pitch; Neuer is both No1 and last defender, an additional safety barrier behind the high line and an extra outlet for passes to break the opposition pressing. “Only Franz Beckenbauer was a better sweeper,” said Germany’s goalkeeping coach, Andreas Köpke, after Neuer had run six kilometres and touched the ball 21 times outside his own box in the last-16 match against Algeria at the World Cup, during which he also saved 85% of all shots on goal. His game can look flash to the uninitiated but Neuer, who has studied the movement of handball and ice hockey goalkeepers for inspiration, says he is simply doing what is best for his sides. “Goalkeepers can’t do their own thing and wait to make a great save on the line anymore,” he has said. “They are team players.

A rare case of a winger who appears to be getting better and more consistent with age, the level the Dutchman reached for club and country this year has seen him rise 10 places on this list and although Robben has just missed out on a place on the podium, it is heartening to see recognition of his talent. Life would be easier if he stayed on his feet a bit more but even his detractors would have to admit that few things are more exhilarating than Robben on the run, snaking inside from the right and bending a shot into the far corner with his left foot. He can be selfish, but the brilliance of Robben is such that his intentions are often predictable and yet defences still cannot stop him. Robben was exceptional for Bayern Munich as they won the Bundesliga and a leader for Holland on their way to finishing third in Brazil. His performance when Holland destroyed Spain 5-1 was one for the ages.","Jacob Steinberg",200,"√ MC","√ SMc","√ SB","√ PC",4,"Mon Jan 12 2015 17:55:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","Footballer100 2014"

Liverpool’s title challenge ended in tears but the World Cup offered another chance to alter his reputation. Recovering from a knee ligament injury to score twice against England was a fairytale for Uruguay’s talismanic forward, but five days later he blew it, or bit it, by sinking his teeth into Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini. His World Cup was over in disgrace. Fifa hit Suárez with a four-month ban from all football-related activity and a nine-match international suspension but the record punishment did not deter Barcelona from signing the striker for £75m in July.

Until Juan Zuñiga’s challenge literally broke Neymar’s back, the striker had carried the host country on his young shoulders. Despite almost unbearable pressure to be Brazil’s hero, he scored two goals in the opening game against Croatia after the host nation had fallen behind and were struggling to find their rhythm. There were another two goals in the last group game against Cameroon before the win on penalties against Chile and then that fateful game against Colombia in Fortaleza. With 42 goals, Neymar is already the fifth-highest scorer in the history of the Seleção and with seven more will pip a certain Zico for fourth place. His record for Barcelona is not bad either: in his first 18 matches for the Blaugrana in 2014-15 Neymar scored 14 goals, three of them in the Champions League. It did help that from his first day in Catalonia Neymar did not try to upstage Lionel Messi, instead happily assuming second-fiddle duties.

Lahm duly scored two goals in the league before suffering a broken ankle in training in November. “We cannot play badly any more,” he said. “That’s mostly due to the  manager, and the variety we now have in our game.” In other words: Bayern have now become a side in his image.","Raphael Honigstein",200,"√ MC","√ SMc","√ PC","√ SB",9,"Mon Jan 12 2015 17:55:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","Footballer100 2014"

For a man pivotal in both City’s Premier League title triumphs this is some achievement, and points to how Agüero has again elevated his game to a new level. Manuel Pellegrini, Samir Nasri and a host of other City players bill him as marginally a class down from Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi and, considering the form the 26-year-old had consistently showed before he was sidelined by a knee injury in early December, it is difficult to argue with that view. The hope now is that Agüero can recover soon and instantly return to the player who – when Pellegrini’s side had a prolonged wobble – kept City in the Premier League title chase and the Champions League almost single-handedly. Who can forget that nerveless hat-trick against Bayern? Agüero featured in five of Argentina’s games as they reached the World Cup final but was not quite able to reproduce his club form on the biggest stage of all.

He will be the creative fulcrum at the heart of the Spain midfield as they begin the post-Xavi era. A European Under-21 champion in 2013, his responsibility is growing. It is not just Spain either: Barcelona tried to sign Koke in the summer as they too embarked on the process of replacing Xavi, only to find that Atlético were not prepared to sell and Koke, who has come up through the club’s youth system and is an Atlético fan, was not prepared to push for a departure. For some, Koke’s introduction into the Spain team should have come sooner.  He was coming off the back of a superb season in which he was the most important creative player for the surprise league champions and had been vitally important in Europe too: his goal saw Atlético beat Barcelona in the quarter-finals. Last season, only Ángel Di María provided more assists in the Spanish league; so far this season, no one has provided more. His evolution is still ongoing. He reads the game well and passes impeccably, but he mostly played in a right-sided midfield role for Atlético last season, rather than in the middle; now he alternates and plays occasional games in the centre. Koke is not yet taking full control, but he soon will.","Sid Lowe",300,"√ MC","√ SMc","√ PC","√ SB",42,"Mon Jan 12 2015 17:55:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","Footballer100 2014"
