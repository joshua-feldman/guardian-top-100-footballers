1,"7","6","Robert Lewandowski","Forward","CENTRE","Bayern Munich","Germany",32,"Poland","Some will mourn the end of the Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo era but it’s really a segue into a new one, of the centre-forward who further excels in his 30s – led by Lewandowski, who is indisputably improving. His numbers are incredible; he finished 2019-20 with 55 goals in 47 club matches for Bayern Munich, and became only the second player to finish top scorer in all three competitions of a treble season after Johan Cruyff for Ajax in 1972. Later he moved into third on the Champions League all-time scorers’ list, level with Raúl. Yet when his coach Hansi Flick says “he’s in the form of his life”, he doesn’t just mean the goals. The 32-year-old Lewandowski still relishes the physical battle of being a No 9 and is a talisman for his younger teammates. With him set to dominate for years to come, Bayern may well do so too.

2,"1","-1","Lionel Messi","Forward","CENTRE","Barcelona","Spain",33,"Argentina","2020 was a Bad Year for Lionel Messi. Last season was about the worst he’s ever had, one in which he scored more goals, created more chances, completed more dribbles and provided more assists than anyone in Spain. Welcome to the absurdity of the outlier on every graph, the man whose career created a new category of footballing classification: “Apart from Messi.” In his worst year – <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/25/lionel-messi-tells-barcelona-he-wants-to-leave-but-faces-legal-battle-over-clause"">so bad he wanted out</a> – he finished 400 points ahead of third and 238 of our 241 judges included him. (And, no, we’re not telling you who the three are). Yet there’s no escaping the truth: in 2020 Messi really wasn’t <italics>that</italics> good, rightly falls well below Lewandowski and even second might be too high, his inclusion partly a product of habit now. Not where he wants to be, in any sense, it’s hard to escape the sadness, the frustration and the fear that the end is nigh.   ","Sid Lowe"
3,"4","1","Cristiano Ronaldo","Forward","LEFT","Juventus","Italy",35,"Portugal","By the standards of one of the greatest footballers ever, this was a forgettable year. Ronaldo picked up his <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/27/maurizio-sarri-serie-a-title-juventus-win-convince-scudetto"">second Serie A winners’ medal</a> – a minimum expectation while playing for a team that have won the league nine seasons running – and not a lot else, as Juventus lost a Coppa Italia final and exited the Champions League in the last 16. The Ballon d’Or was cancelled, but Ronaldo failed even to win the Italian top flight’s MVP. Yet this was still a year when he equalled a Serie A record by scoring in 11 consecutive league games and a year when he notched his 100th (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/sep/12/cristiano-ronaldos-101-portugal-goals-a-product-of-unceasing-appetite"">and 101st</a>) goal for Portugal, becoming the first European men’s player ever to hit that landmark in internationals. Only three of our judges had him as the world’s best player – down from 11 in 2019 – but the consensus ranking speaks to how many ballots placed him very close indeed.","Nicky Bandini"

As a Manchester City player De Bruyne will not have enjoyed 2020 as much as the two years that preceded it, though he remains by some distance the side's most creative and consistent influence. At least he does in theory. A relatively quiet end to the year – he was all but anonymous in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/12/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report"">the sterile Manchester derby this month</a> – has led to renewed accusations that De Bruyne goes missing against the big teams in a way that rarely happens with Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. While the suggestion that De Bruyne is the football equivalent of a flat-track bully might be criticism at the very highest level, anyone who has seen what he can do knows that is precisely where he belongs. ","Paul Wilson"
5,"3","-2","Sadio Mané","Forward","LEFT","Liverpool","England",28,"Senegal","A fall of two places is difficult to comprehend given that the Senegal international continued his development into one of the most dangerous forwards in the game during 2020. His contribution to Liverpool's first league title success for 30 years is reflected, however, in his position as the highest-ranked player from Jürgen Klopp's team. Mané managed to eclipse the outstanding Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino last season as Liverpool claimed the Club World Cup and Premier League titles. The 28-year-old scored 18 goals and provided seven assists as Liverpool claimed their long-awaited 19th league championship with considerable ease, although statistics alone do not measure Mané's importance. He scored critical goals, such as <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/aston-villa-liverpool-premier-league-match-report"">the last-minute winner at Aston Villa</a> that opened a decisive gap in the title race as early as November last year, tormented defenders and epitomised the focus, class and industry of Klopp's team. He was also <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/07/liverpools-sadio-mane-named-african-footballer-of-the-year-for-first-time"">named African Footballer of the Year</a> for the first time in January.","Andy Hunter"
6,"53","47","Erling Braut Haaland","Forward","CENTRE","Borussia Dortmund","Germany",20,"Norway","Some eyebrows may be raised at Haaland figuring as high as sixth on our list, one place (and a mere 14 points) above Kylian Mbappé but the Norwegian’s 2020 has been nothing short of sensational. This time last year Haaland was still a Red Bull Salzburg player. Sure, he had already scored eight Champions League goals for the Austrian side during the 2019-20 group stage but no one could have anticipated he would settle so quickly at Borussia Dortmund, whom he joined on 1 January. Haaland’s debut for Dortmund came against Augsburg and he <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/european-football-roundup-borussia-dortmund-augsburg-erling-haaland-lazio-sampdoria"">promptly scored a 23-minute hat-trick</a> after coming off the bench. He then scored a double in his next two Bundesliga games, against Cologne and Union Berlin, and has not looked back. By mid-December he had 33 goals in 32 games for Dortmund. ""The most frightening thing,"" Lucien Favre said after Haaland’s debut, ""is that he is only going to get better.""","Marcus Christenson"
7,"6","-1","Kylian Mbappé","Forward","CENTRE","Paris St-Germain","France",22,"France","Mbappé is obviously a phenomenon. He achieved more before turning 22 than most players achieve in their entire careers, and he is one of the most thrilling players on the planet when on song. And this year he helped Paris Saint-Germain make it – at last - past the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Yet he has slipped one place in the 100. Maybe that is because, awesome though he is, he has not been as brilliant as he could have been this year. Not consistently. He flopped in the Champions League final</a> and there have been times this year when he has seemed to rely too much on his speed, in contrast with previous years when his exceptional awareness and decision-making were among the qualities that made him so exciting. His development stalled a tad. Very few players merit both an A grade and the comment ""could do better"". Perhaps a move from PSG would stimulate him?","Paul Doyle"
8,"5","-3","Mohamed Salah","Forward","RIGHT","Liverpool","England",28,"Egypt","The Egypt international makes the list for the sixth year in succession. His output remains phenomenally consistent too. After a slow start to last season, at least by his elevated standards, Salah hit his productive stride and rarely wavered to help <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/25/how-liverpool-became-premier-league-champions"">Liverpool finally claim the Premier League title</a> with 19 goals and 10 assists. He ended the campaign as the first Liverpool player since Michael Owen 17 years previously to score 20 goals or more in all competitions in three consecutive seasons. There has been no let-up this term either, and his 11 league goals by 16 December have been invaluable to a team defending their title while suffering a procession of injuries in defence. Salah became Liverpool's all-time leading goalscorer in the Champions League with his 22nd in the competition against Midtjylland and has scored a truly remarkable 108 goals in 172 appearances for the club at the time of writin","Andy Hunter"
9,"31","22","Neymar","Forward","CENTRE","Paris St-Germain","France",28,"Brazil","To concentrate on his irritating habits is to detract from the enjoyment of all the wonderful, courageous things that Neymar does – and he does them not simply to amuse himself but, increasingly, to help his team. He rose 22 places in the top 100 because this was the year when he mostly put his extraordinary skills to the service of the PSG collective, graduating from brand ambassador to genuine leader on the pitch. Teammates give him the ball no matter how many opponents are around him because they can count on him to create or score a goal even where there appears to be no chance. He did not shine <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/23/bayern-munich-paris-saint-germain-psg-champions-league-final-match-report"">in the Champions League final</a> but he played a key role in them getting there at last and in December inspired another advance to the knockout stages by showing Manchester United what a world-class player is. He remains precious to his country, too, closing in on Pelé's all-time scoring record for Brazil.","Paul Doyle"
10,"2","-8","Virgil van Dijk","Defender","CENTRE","Liverpool","England",29,"Netherlands","Still the best defender in the world but no longer the second best player on our list, which does not come as a huge surprise. Partly because it was impossible for Van Dijk to replicate the incredible form and consistency he showed in 2019 and partly because he has been sidelined since <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/18/liverpool-virgil-van-dijk-cruciate-injury-facing-surgery-and-long-absence-knee"">suffering a serious knee injury</a> in October’s Merseyside derby. A case of out of action, out of mind, but Van Dijk nevertheless deserves his place in the top 10 having been an ever-present and crucial part of a Liverpool team that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/25/how-liverpool-became-premier-league-champions"">deservedly won the Premier League title</a> this year, as well as again proving an important and impressive figure for his country.","Sachin Nakrani"
11,"37","26","Joshua Kimmich","Midfielder","CENTRE","Bayern Munich","Germany",25,"Germany","Another player who found clarity and contentment at Bayern under Hansi Flick. Some will say the ultra-reliable Kimmich never needed that, but Flick’s decree that he is a midfielder rather than a right-back helped Kimmich elevate his game and teases the frightening prospect that this team totem will become even better in years to come. His intelligence and grit are unmatched, plus he scored the sublime winner at Dortmund in May that all but sealed Bayern’s latest Bundesliga title. True to form he played a star turn <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/23/bayern-munich-paris-saint-germain-psg-champions-league-final-match-report"">in the Champions League final</a> – filling in as a right-back, of course.

12,"20","8","Karim Benzema","Forward","CENTRE","Real Madrid","Spain",33,"France","“That’s how I see football,” Benzema said after he produced <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jun/29/karim-benzema-real-madrid-backheel-sums-up-la-liga-weekend-of-beauty-and-brilliance"">a gorgeous backheeled assist against Espanyol</a>. And now it seems others see football his way too. They have taken a long time; after a decade at Real Madrid, much of it spent facilitating Cristiano Ronaldo, it feels like Benzema is only now getting fully recognised. Not so much a No 9 as a nine and a half, an all-round player rather than out-and-out goalscorer, he was top scorer and the key attacker in Real Madrid’s league title success. “Anyone who likes football likes Karim,” Zinedine Zidane says. Bonjour, Didier.","Sid Lowe"
13,"36","23","Sergio Ramos","Defender","CENTRE","Real Madrid","Spain",34,"Spain","Up 23 places, the second highest defender on this list, and he won’t be happy to find anyone above him. Ramos is an almost cartoonish footballer, all wild and epic. At 34, he should be getting worse, but there’s no sign of that and if you want a measure of his significance, just take a look at Real Madrid without him. Have a listen, in fact: even when he’s not playing, his is the voice you can hear at Valdebebas, shouting from the empty stands. He led them to the league title last season and is closing in on the all-time, worldwide record for international caps.","Sid Lowe"
14,"174","Re-entry","Thomas Müller","Forward","CENTRE","Bayern Munich","Germany",31,"Germany","For years, Müller has been underestimated outside Germany (and inside too to an extent, with Jogi Löw removing him from national team consideration), with many wondering how to define what exactly it is that the Raumdeuter (""space interpreter"") does. Niko Kovac certainly struggled to find Müller pride of place in his team, but Hansi Flick has allowed him to be himself to spectacular effect. The 31-year-old has chipped in with goals but piled on the assists, with 21 in the Bundesliga alone last term. He is also part of Bayern’s soul – combative, dogged, refusing to be beaten and full of craft. ","Andy Brassell"
15,"113","Re-entry","Manuel Neuer","Goalkeeper","CENTRE","Bayern Munich","Germany",34,"Germany","The year began with heated debate in Germany over whether Neuer should even be Germany’s first-choice goalkeeper, with Marc-André ter Stegen having matured into Barcelona’s most important player after Lionel Messi. Bayern’s Champions League quarter-final demolition of Barça shouldn’t be taken as a turning point or proof of respective quality, though. Neuer’s revival this year is all his own doing, with the post-pandemic resolution of his contract standoff with Bayern clearing his mind and restoring him to his 2014 peak after a couple of indifferent years by his standards. He was key <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/23/bayern-munich-paris-saint-germain-psg-champions-league-final-match-report"">in the Champions League final</a>, too.","Andy Brassell"
16,"38","22","Serge Gnabry","Winger","RIGHT","Bayern Munich","Germany",25,"Germany","Gnabry’s former coach Tony Pulis is often ridiculed for once saying the winger wasn’t good enough for his West Brom team. If we’re honest, no one could have expected this version, where electric pace is allied with vision, razor-sharp passing and explosive finishes with either foot. The 25-year-old weighs in at big moments, with his brilliant goal setting the tone in the Champions League semi-final win over Lyon. He is also prolific for Germany, despite the current state of flux in Jogi Löw’s team. There has been an attempt to nickname Gnabry and Leroy Sané ""Snabry"" in tribute to their wing predecessors, but his influence deserves to be lauded on its own.","Andy Brassell"
17,"","Re-entry","Thiago Alcântara","Midfielder","CENTRE","Liverpool","England",29,"Spain","The midfielder rightly returns to this list having missed out in the previous two years. He was the beating heart of a Bayern Munich side that won the treble, making 41 appearances across all competitions and impressing with his passing and composure in practically every one, and the Spaniard would probably find himself higher than 17th were it not for his frequent absences since moving to Liverpool in September due to a combination of Covid-19 and being the other member of Jürgen Klopp’s side to suffer a serious knee injury at the hands of Everton. A wonderful player and the second-highest Spain international on this list, after Sergio Ramos.","Sachin Nakrani"
18,"17","-1","Trent Alexander-Arnold","Defender","RIGHT","Liverpool","England",22,"England","Liverpool's full-backs have redefined the role and Alexander-Arnold's ability to shape a game from right-back was unerring as his boyhood team cruised to the Premier League title. The homegrown talent surpassed his own record for the number of Premier League assists by a defender with 13 last season and featured in every league game for Jürgen Klopp's champions. His importance is reflected by his position as the highest ranked English player on the list, overtaking Harry Kane, and by the captain's armband he received for the first – but certainly not the last – time against Midtjylland in the Champions League.","Andy Hunter"
19,"51","32","Romelu Lukaku","Forward","CENTRE","Internazionale","Italy",27,"Belgium","This has felt like a brilliant year but also a cursed one for Lukaku, the stand-out performer in an Inter team who finished as runners-up in Serie A and the Europa League. He won player of the tournament for the latter competition after scoring in all his team’s games, yet his <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/21/internazionale-sevilla-europa-league-final-match-report"">own goal in the final was decisive</a>, as was his accidental block of an Alexis Sánchez header as Inter dropped out of the Champions League.

20,"15","-5","Harry Kane","Forward","CENTRE","Tottenham Hotspur","England",27,"England","Kane is riding the crest of a wave. “I’d say it’s probably the best form I’ve been in in my life,” the Tottenham striker said after scoring in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/06/tottenham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report"">his team’s win over Arsenal</a> on 6 December. The goals have continued to flow during a year that began with a serious hamstring tear. But it has been the development of his all-round game that has taken him to a new level. Kane has always been a fine passer; a No 10 as well as a No 9. Now, as he has dropped deeper to pick out the runs of Son Heung-min in particular, he also has the assist stats to dazzle.

Made such an immediate impact at Manchester United that people are already saying he is responsible for keeping Ole Gunnar Solskjær in a job. Certainly his input was central to United claiming a Champions League place last season, not to mention putting the Paul Pogba problem on a back burner, and if Solskjær had 11 players like Fernandes his prospects would look a lot more secure. As it is the Portugal international stands out like a beacon in a side struggling for consistency. Going out of the Champions League early will have been a major disappointment.  ","Paul Wilson"

Maybe it is the smile, the clear impression that he loves what he does. Or perhaps it is the wholehearted commitment that is underpinned by good sportsmanship. More likely it is the pace and ruthlessness, the feeling that this is a forward hellbent on finding new ways to be effective. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/31/in-this-strange-season-son-heung-min-and-harry-kane-put-spurs-in-the-title-mix"">After a hot start in 2020-21</a>, he is on course for his highest goals return from a season.","David Hytner"

Arriving from MLS as a teenage winger of some promise, Davies finished last season as perhaps already the world’s best left-back. Reassigned to defence by Niko Kovac in an injury crisis to cover record signing Lucas Hernández, Davies impressed Hansi Flick enough to make it a more permanent arrangement. Davies’s acceleration makes him dangerous when attacking from deep positions, he has great quality on the ball and has learned to defend admirably quickly.","Andy Brassell"

On his way to matching Serie A’s single-season scoring record, he helped Lazio to reach the Champions League for the first time in more than a decade. He then struck five times in four group-stage appearances – including two against the Borussia Dortmund side who discarded him five years ago – to push Lazio on toward the last 16.","Nicky Bandini"

Only two other keepers, Ederson and Nick Pope, kept more. Injuries have struck again this season but Alisson's presence continues to make a telling difference to the Liverpool team and not only defensively.

Yeah, so he’s been on this list every year since 2016, and in the top half too, but seen from Spain even that can feel like it underplays his significance. And maybe that makes sense: the Slovenian somehow manages to make even spectacular saves look standard, almost routine, like he was always going to get to that ball heading into the top corner. There’s no rolling about, no ostentatious shouting, and no media profile at all. He’s just there every day, doing his job – really, really well.","Sid Lowe"

Sancho just gets better and better; he is one of only five players in our ranking who are aged 20 or younger and it is a tantalising thought that he should have at least a decade left at the very top. Last season he was electric, scoring 17 Bundesliga goals and providing 16 assists; the start to this term in a spluttering side has been slower but he remains a class act who blends explosiveness with a preternatural precision and ability to make the right choice. He would fit into any side in the world, although the price would be steep: the question appears to be when, rather than if, United or any of their rivals manage to get a deal over the line.","Nick Ames"

Recast as a centre-back in response to a Bayern defensive injury crisis the elegant Austrian has been phenomenal, a tough customer whose expertise in bringing the ball out is key to the team’s attacking impetus. As the loudest member of the team – something reaffirmed in empty stadiums – Alaba has also been integral to in-game coaching Alphonso Davies, all of which makes his potential departure at the end of his contract alarming.
